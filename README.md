Some people spend a lot of money to learn Python, but in fact, it is also possible to learn Python by yourself. If you are not in a hurry, you can try to learn it by yourself. Not everyone is suitable for learning Python. It is not a good decision to start spending money at this time. It is recommended to find resources to learn by yourself first. If you are still interested in programming after learning for a period of time, then you can continue to learn by yourself or spend some money "by car". 

Self-study is more about resources and methods. I have sorted out this aspect, and the Python resources I have collected are available to everyone. As long as you are my fan, you can take away the following items. 

Let me introduce these resources first, don't you don't know how to use them when you get them, and finally put them in the network disk. 

(1) The learning path in all directions of Python (new version) 

The learning roadmap is a compilation of technical points in a certain direction to form a summary of knowledge points in various fields. Its usefulness is that you can follow the above knowledge points to find corresponding learning resources to ensure that you learn more comprehensively. 

Previously, I made a learning roadmap for all directions of Python, and recently I took the time to update it to see that the learning roadmap for all directions is more detailed.

 ​​ 

(PS: If you are already in the exchange group, you can directly ask the administrator for it) 

(2) Python learning videos 

It contains more than 100 learning videos on Python beginners, crawlers, data analytics, and web development. Although it is not as comprehensive, it is no problem for beginners. After learning these, you can follow my learning route to find other knowledge resources online to advance. 

![avatar]( d66e3ad5592f4cdcb197de0dc0438ec5.png) 

(3) More than 100 practice projects 

When we watch videos to learn, we can't just use our eyes and brains without doing anything. The more scientific learning method is to use them after understanding. At this time, the practice project is very suitable, but there are many projects in it, and the level is also uneven. You can choose the projects you can do to practice. 

![avatar]( f5aeb4050ab547cf90b1a028d1aacb1d.png) 

(4) More than 200 e-books. Over the years, I have also collected a lot of e-books, probably more than 200. Sometimes it is inconvenient to bring physical books, so I will open the e-books to have a look. Books are not necessarily worse than video tutorials, especially authoritative technical books. 

Basically, there are both mainstream and classic ones. I will not put pictures here. There is no problem with copyright issues. 

(5) Summary of Python knowledge points 

The summary of knowledge points is a bit like a learning route, but the difference from the learning route is that the summary of knowledge points is more detailed, including a simple description of specific knowledge points, while our learning route is more abstract and simple, just to make it easier for everyone to learn which technology stacks you should learn in a certain field.

(6) Other information 

![avatar]( 34a8eec9c1a5456f8ea220fdf21404f2.png) 

 There are other things, such as Python Chinese version of the library information, MySQL and HTML tags, etc., which are all things that can be given to fans.  

These are not very valuable things, but for learners who don't have many resources or don't know how to choose resources, they are really good. If you use them, you can just take them away. Anyone who has followed me knows that these are all available.

Of course, the current one can only crawl the data in one effect package. It is also very simple to crawl the data of multiple effect packages or all effect packages. It is not difficult to find one of them by analyzing the URL change law of the effect package. If you change the keyword flexibly, you can continue to crawl it.

###  Today's content preview 

Python is a programming language. In the eyes of developers, languages can be divided into three categories: 

Similarly, in the eyes of developers, it can also be divided into high-level programming languages and low-level programming languages. The closer to human languages, the higher the level, such as Python; the closer to machine languages, the lower the level, such as assembly, is a low-level programmer design language. 

Drink water without forgetting to dig wells. Before we officially learn Python, it is necessary for us to understand the past of Python and our ancestors. 

Python was created by Guido van Rossum during Christmas in 1989. Domestic programmers prefer simple but simple names, so they took the first three letters of his name, gui, and were nicknamed Uncle Turtle. The origin of Python's name also originated from Uncle Turtle's preference, because Uncle Turtle at that time preferred the sketch "Monty Python's Flying Circus", so he called the language he created Python.

 Uncle Turtle is only 65 years old this year, and he still has a lot of hair, so friends who learn Python don't have to worry too much about baldness. Uncle Turtle, I remember joining the development department of Microsoft last year, and he is still writing code in the front line when he is old, which is really admirable.

Python is mainly characterized by concise syntax, powerful class libraries, glue language (calling class libraries in other languages), and less code. This simple understanding is enough, and you will understand when you use it later. 

>  (Whoever uses it knows) 

There are two main mechanisms for running a program: compiled and interpreted. Compiled is to compile code (source files) into machine code files through a compiler, and directly execute machine code files when running, such as C language; interpreted is to translate and run source files line by line through an interpreter. 

Python is an interpreted language. 

Compiled and interpreted languages have their own advantages and disadvantages. 

Disadvantages: Slow execution, Advantages: Can be cross-platform (operating system) 

Disadvantages: cannot be cross-platform, advantages: fast execution 

For beginners learning Python, I suggest installing Python and Pycharm. I will often use these two software when writing code in the future. Both software can be downloaded from the official website. If you don't want to go to the official website to download, I also have a good installation package. After picking it up, you can start the installation process. 

>  Software package download link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BtnMGsfYNFIkmJ26wuGjCw Extraction code: al6e 

The installation of Python can be downloaded directly from the official website. Since it is a foreign website, the response and download speed may be a little slow. If you are not in a hurry, just wait. If you want to be faster, use Xunlei to download quickly. 

![avatar]( ebab87d225aa4df9ab65c9a1555f0a04.png) 

 The download address is ttps://www.python.org/downloads/, or you can enter the download page from the official outlet Downloads, select the corresponding version of your computer, mine is a Windows computer, so just click Windows directly.  

Python is currently 3.9.7 version, you can see that there are many versions to choose from to download, I use 3.9.5 this version, and then choose the model according to the computer, my computer is 64-bit, so I download 64-bit software.

- Install Python 

![avatar]( b9fe178e4466486e9ac151b4ad898fbb.png) 

 Double-click the downloaded file to enter the installation interface. Select Custom Install and check both options to install Python into the PATH. This interface does not change, just click Next. Choose a path you want to install, otherwise it will install you to the C drive, I will install it to the D drive, and then click Install. After the installation is complete, click Close. 

![avatar]( 3ec5fbbe35c84f349b451c0651e86841.png) 

To test whether your Python installation is successful, the WIN + R keys bring up the command window and enter cmd. 

![avatar]( b52b7c687de04e769b556f687fbe3ec7.png) 

 ![avatar]( a6b833b0e1c544a1873775623d34dc15.png) 

  Enter Python in the black window, and then press Enter. If you prompt Python 3.9.6 and other information, it means that the installation has been successful. If there is no prompt, go back and see which environment you made a mistake.  

Download from the official website of Pycharm, choose the system, I am a Windows system, so the default remains unchanged, and then download the community version, and then use the professional version when you become stronger. 

![avatar]( 067e7101e9d541809dd96863f987432f.png) 

  After downloading, double-click to start the installation.

We are ready to write our first line of code, the famous Hello World. 

![avatar]( f51043e456f745318e353ff388ff5db9.png) 

 Open Pycharm, click New Project to create a new project, and you can do this for new projects in the future. Open in the middle is to open the project. If you have a written project, you can open it from here.  

The next step is to set the location of the project. If you follow my steps when installing Pycharm, the Base interpreter will automatically detect Python. You can do it without changing it, just click Create in the lower left corner to create it.

 ![avatar]( 3c381717d12144f69ccb7ea1164b91e6.png) 

  Then click on the left. A pop-up box will pop up when entering the page. Just click Close to close it.  

What we created earlier is a project, which is a folder to store the source code. Here we start to create the source code files. (My computer had some projects before, so there are many folders below, which may not be the same as yours.) 

Click on the email pop-up option python_learn create a good project, select New to create a new one, and select Python File to create a Python source file.

 ![avatar]( 4f33ceeb1b464824bda69d91bb742930.png) 

  Then you will be prompted to give your file a name, and then hit enter to complete the creation of the code source file. To start writing code, one of the most commonly used functions, print (), is used to output content. Functions have their syntax. As long as you follow the syntax to write code, the software will know what you want to do. 

The syntax of print is as follows, with a newline by default.

 ```  
Next, we are going to output our first line of code. Hello world is a string. You need to add "" to be the correct format, otherwise an error will be reported. We will discuss the string in detail later. Here, you only need to know that you have to write code in this format to achieve the desired result.

 ```  
![avatar]( c1e0cee747324be78d6891b67a6e9c4d.png) 

 After writing the code, you need to run it to get the result. You can right-click the pop-up option box and select Run 'learn_1 'to start running. Run means run, learn_1 is the name I gave this source file just now. In addition to right-clicking to run, you can also directly use shortcut Ctrl + Shift + F10 to execute the result:

  Congratulations, you have exported your first line of code and officially started your Python journey! 

Before you can write code in Python, you must have a basic knowledge of Python, otherwise you may struggle with it. Basic knowledge includes input and output, variables, data types, expressions, and operators. 

Python has many functions, which we will discuss in detail later, but here are the two most basic functions: input and output. 

The output function print (), which we have used before, has the following syntax: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
The input function is input (), the function is to receive user input, and the syntax is: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Example: Receive a password entered by a user and print it

 ```  
In Python, "#" indicates a comment, and the things after "#" will not be executed. After the code runs, "Please enter your password:" appears first, and then enter it at will, such as entering 123, and the execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Successfully receives user input and prints it out. 

A variable is a name that needs to be assigned before use. Variables must conform to the naming convention of identifiers (names). This is a hard requirement. Identifiers are equivalent to names, including variable names, function names, class names, etc. 

>  Keywords: if while for as import reserved words: input, print range 

>  1. Package name: all lowercase, such as time;

  2. Class name: the first letter of each word is uppercase, other lowercase, short for big hump naming, such as HelloWorld;

  3. Variable name/function name: the first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of the following word is uppercase, which is abbreviated as a small hump name, such as helloWorld;

  4. Constants: all caps, such as Hello. 

Data types can be divided into the following six categories:

 ```  
When writing code, we often need to convert different data types. The main data type conversion methods are as follows: 

(1) string to integer 

The method is int (str), and the string must be a number, for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
(2) Floating point type to integer type 

The method is int (float), for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```

 ```  
(3) string to float, the method is float (str), the string must be the sum of numbers, for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798

(1) The type () syntax is type (object), which returns the type of the object. We have also used it before, but it is returned internally. If you don't output it, you can't see it, so it is often nested with the output function print (). 

Example: Get the data type and output it. 

 ```python

Class means type, and it can be seen that f is data of type int. 

(2) isinstance () isinstance () is often used to determine the data type, it returns a boolean value (True or False), and the syntax is isinstance (object, class). 

Example: Determine whether 30.5 is an integer.

In Python, expressions are combinations of numbers, operators, numeric group symbols (parentheses), variables, and other objects called expressions. Expressions have fixed literal values. For example, the value of the expression "10 + 20" is 30, and the value of the expression "10 > 30" is False. 

Operators can be divided into four categories. 

(1) General Operators 

>  +，-，*，/（ true division),//(floor division, fractional part is rounded),% (remainder), ** (exponentiation) 

(2) Assignment operator 

>  The commonly used assignment operator is =, and the value to the right of the equal sign is assigned to the left of the equal sign 

>  Enhanced assignment operator ：+=，-=，*=，/=,%=,**=

(3) Boolean arithmetic 

>  == (equal to),! = (not equal to ） >= <= > < 

(4) Logical operators 

>  There are three main categories: not, and and or, also known as non, and or and: if both before and after are true, it is true or: if one is true, it is true not: not true, not false

Flow control is commonly used in the if/else statement of the conditional branch process and the while statement of the loop control. 

Code that only triggers when certain conditions are met. 

(1) Grammar 1 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
The Boolean expression has only two results, either true or false. If it is true, then the code block in the if statement is executed, otherwise it is skipped. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
From this, it can be seen that the boolean expression (a < b) in the first if statement is true, so the code block print ("true") inside is executed, while the boolean expression (a > b) in the second if statement is false, so the code block inside is not executed, so the word "false" is not output. 

(2) Syntax 2 The commonly used if/else statement has the following syntax: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
The logic of the judgment is that if the boolean expression is true, the code block inside the if is executed, and if it is false, the code inside the else is executed. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
(3) Grammar 3 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
The logic is that if the boolean expression is true, the code inside the if is executed, and if it is false, the code inside the else is executed. This syntax applies to multiple consecutive conditional judgments. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Feel free to enter numbers within 100. The results of numbers in different intervals are different, such as 92. The execution result is: 

 ```python

 ```  
(4) Syntax 4 Here we can use the previously mentioned if/elif/else nested to achieve our desired purpose. 

example 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798

 ```  
The function of the flow control statement we talked about earlier is still relatively limited. For example, it can only be executed once, and it is a bit troublesome to write a few more to execute multiple times. Therefore, we need to learn the loop statement in the loop process. Its function is to run some code repeatedly. 

(1) While cycle 

Grammar: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
The code block inside is executed as long as the condition (Boolean expression) is true. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
After running, you can enter the score multiple times and never stop. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Of course, there is a drawback here. After the code is executed, it falls into an infinite loop, while the code inside is executed all the time, because 4 < 5 is always true. 

So here we can improve the code, don't let it execute forever, let it loop a few times on it, here you can use a variable as a condition to judge, change 4 < 5 to a < 5, and let the self-adding function be implemented in the while. Every time the code is executed in the while, when it is executed to its line, it adds 1, so that it will jump out when it is executed twice.

 ```  
Here I will give you another example to understand the use of the while loop. For example, enter an integer and calculate the sum of each bit, for example, enter 321, then the sum of each bit is 6. 

 ```python

 ```  
I entered 2345, and the execution result: 

 ```python

 ```  
(2) The for loop and the while loop are both loop statements, but the difference is that the for loop is a technical loop. 

Grammar: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Execute: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
L is a list. We will talk about it later. There are three elements in the list. Every time a for loop is executed, the elements in the list will be assigned to n. Until there are no elements in the list to assign, n will jump out of the list. At this time, the for loop will not be established and the code block in the for will not be executed. 

(3) The range for loop is often used with range, which is an iterable object. The syntax of range is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
The start value is the start subscript. All elements in the range sequence have subscripts, and the subscript of the first element is 0, so the default is 0. 

Stop is the end position. The end position subscript is (number of elements -1). For example, if there are 4 elements in the range, the end subscript is up to 3, and if it is greater than 3, it will jump out of the range. 

Step is the step size. If step is 2, then each element will be separated by 1. The default step size is 1, that is, each element will be fetched. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
From the first for loop, it can be seen that the subscript of the first element of range () starts from 0, not from 1; range () can not write the start subscript and step size, but must have an end position; the second for loop can see that the step size can be negative, used for decrement. 

(4) The function of continue continues is to skip this loop and continue the execution of subsequent loops, for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
Obviously, when i is equal to 5, the for loop is skipped, and the code inside is no longer executed this time, returning to a new loop. 

Similarly, there is also the function of terminating all loops, that is, break, which is the same usage as continue, but the effect is different. I will not give an example here. You can try it and find out. 

Lists can hold any data, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, etc., and are one of the commonly used data types. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798
 ```  
The list is subscripted, and the subscript starts from 0. Elements refer to each data in the list. For example, there are 5 elements in l = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], but the subscript of 5 is 0, and the subscript of 1 is 4.

When writing code, we often need to write documentation. We have mentioned that #and three quotation marks can be used to comment the code, but here we want to introduce a new method, which is also a commonly used function documentation format when writing code: In the first line of the function body, use “”" “”" to document, which is a standardized function documentation. 

For example: 

![avatar]( 789c89b532e2483cb25d62a8cb0dde58.png) 

  After you have the function documentation, you can obtain the documentation content of the function by:

 For example, in addition to this, you can also use help (function name) to view the function documentation, for example:

 ```  
First, you need to understand two concepts: local variables and global variables. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515798

 ```  
![avatar]( 13e75edcca8b45159f10b75293071632.png) 

The function defined inside a function is called an inline function (or an inner function), and the scope of the inner function: from the beginning of the definition to the end of the code block contained to him cannot perform operations such as a += 1, a = a + 1 in the inner function. The solution is nonlocal and global. 

![avatar]( 970fedf74e0f4420bca37b9a07a2210e.png) 

 For example:  

Closures are an important syntax structure of functional programming. 

Programming paradigm: A programming paradigm that refines and abstracts code to make it more reusable 

If the inner function calls a local variable of the outer function, and the outer function returns the function object (function name) of the inner function, for example: 

![avatar]( a28ccbfa7d404a828b7baae6db1ea003.png) 

  This results in closures, which can pass fewer parameters and more arguments - safer, more indirect access to internal functions, such as: 

![avatar]( 387865931a7848b782ca5a8f3b922c76.png) 

  Of course, closures are conditional.

 ```  
After learning these basics, what do you think of your level? Did you just float over like this? To be honest, there are not many things you can do after learning these basics. The fun things can only be made after getting started. 

But here in Uncle Long, there are still comprehensive projects. According to the basic knowledge of loops, lists, functions, etc., as I mentioned above, you can try to write a comprehensive project to test your knowledge. You can try to write a simple business card management system. 

1. The program starts, displays the welcome interface of the business card management system, and displays the function menu

 ```  
2. The user selects different functions with numbers 3. Perform different functions according to the function selection 4. The user's business card needs to record the user's name, phone number, QQ, and email 5. If the specified business card is found, the user can select, modify, or delete the business card 

After roughly understanding the requirements of this operating system, let's not busy looking at the code first. Let's take a look at the effect of the code after it runs. This is what we need to do: 

I won't put the video here. The article with the video will automatically play when you open it. This is a bit speechless, especially for long articles like mine. Where can't you find the video after searching for a long time? Hahaha... So let's put the link to the video demonstration for everyone! 

Video effect link: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1aZ4y1F7n6/ 

Next time I will publish a special article about this business card management system project. Now you can try to write it yourself for the time being. You can also ask me for a private chat with the source code.

###  foreword 

All along, many friends who want to learn Python have asked me, how to learn Python? How to learn crawlers and data analytics? Can you teach me the learning path of web development? 

Let me tell you something first. No matter what training course you sign up for or whether you are self-learning through various channels, you must pay attention to one thing: a complete body of knowledge. 

Feeling very confused? After learning for a while, you are still not fluent? A large part of the reason is that you do not have a complete knowledge system, and you do not know your current progress and future direction. 

On the third day of the Dragon Boat Festival, although I went back to the countryside, I still took the time to do the learning route of all directions of Python, and I will share it with you today. 

###  Getting Started with Python 

Beginners will be curious. After learning Python for so long, to what extent is it considered an entry point? 

Everyone has a different understanding of technology. In my personal opinion, you can start with the following things. Why? Because the following things are the basic knowledge necessary for Python to advance in all directions. If you advance to learn crawling or web development, you must first learn them. 

Because there are many knowledge points together, I divide them into basic and advanced programming. For every self-taught person, follow this system to lay a solid foundation, and your future path will be more stable. 

Applicable crowd: Those with zero foundation/poor foundation, learning Python starts here 

![avatar]( 20210615151249871.png) 

###  Second, reptiles 

As a popular direction, crawling is a good choice whether it is a part-time job or an auxiliary skill to improve work efficiency. Of course, there are also some crawler engineers who use this as their main profession. 

So how can crawlers learn to become a system? Intermediate level crawlers don't need a lot of things. Refer to this system to learn. If you can master 90%, you can confidently say that you are proficient in crawlers. 

![avatar]( 20210615151745684.png) 

 Applicable crowd: crawler direction/data analytics direction/non-programmer salary increase  

###  III. Data analytics 

Everyone knows that data is the most precious thing in this era, but there is a premise that you must understand that all data that does not function properly is junk data. 

The mission of data analytics is to play the role that data should play: direct and indirect. 

If you are an IT professional engaged in big data-related work, I suggest you master but don't stop at the following data systems. Don't think that if you know Numpy, Pandas, or Matplotlib, you will know data analytics. The truly powerful things are yet to come. 

If you regard data analytics as an auxiliary skill, then after learning the following, they can meet most of your needs. Some small partners may still be non-computer professionals and engage in non-IT jobs, such as operations, then I suggest you learn Python beginners + crawlers + data analytics, they are enough to improve your work efficiency in the workplace, without wasting time in the direction of full stack, testing, etc., which is not of great help to you. 

![avatar]( 20210615152348547.png) 

 Applicable crowd: crawler direction/data analytics direction/non-programmer salary increase  

###  IV. Web development (front/back end) 

Web development is a hot topic in the programmer profession. At present, there is still a large talent gap. Web development is divided into three directions: front-end, back-end, and full-stack. At present, the mainstream in China is still separated from the front-end and back-end. The front-end mainly considers user experience, and the back-end mainly considers the underlying business logic, platform stability, and performance. The most important thing is which part do you want to do? Do you like to be the part that the user can see, or consider the part that the user cannot see? 

As for the full stack, public opinion has been very strong, with mixed reviews. My advice is that if time and effort permit, it is not wrong to pursue a more comprehensive technical approach. 

![avatar]( 20210615161920824.png) 

 Applicable audience: front-end/back-end/full-stack engineers   

###  V. Automated testing 

Automated testing is a trend in the future. Nowadays, many enterprises require programmers to have the ability to automate testing. For the field of automated testing, Python is currently the most suitable language.

###  Six, machine learning 

Machine learning is the only way to artificial intelligence, and the difficulty is much greater than the previous one. Dealing with algorithms is commonplace, and high pay will also bring high returns. The salary is very good. Although Python is indeed very strong in this regard, it reminds everyone that the threshold in this field is relatively high, and undergraduates are basically excluded. It is recommended to obtain a master's degree or above before considering entering this industry. 

![avatar]( 20210615163139129.png) 

###  Message 

The above is the learning path for all directions of Python. After mastering 90% of the directions you are interested in, it is not a problem for you to find a job. 

Some attentive friends may find that I did not put the artificial intelligence learning route. To be honest, artificial intelligence is much more extensive than machine learning, and it is no longer something that can be done alone in a certain language, so it is not recommended here. 

Similarly, cyber security engineers I did not include in the talk, although Python can also do cyber security things, but for a mature cyber security engineer or even red, H customers, you need to be proficient in more than one language, or that this is no longer a problem at the level of language tools. 

Then, I wish you all success in your studies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you only rely on what you learn in school to find a job, can you find a job? 

Today, I will show you a real job search case of a fan. I want to do a job in Python, but I submitted more than 20 resumes but no one wanted them. My mentality collapsed. Why no one wants them? I will tell you the answer. 

![avatar]( 80f332c03be544899cf99657bd32a2ac.jpeg) 

Then I will combine my years of recruitment and development experience to give some good advice to all college students. If you can do what I say, you will be eager to submit your resume to companies. 

###  First, real college student job search cases 

This is the real job search situation of one of my fans, and I also gave him corresponding suggestions later. The chat record has been negotiated with him, and he agrees to put it in the article after coding. 

![avatar]( c0f82cc4aa0748569d4de52c7e94f4e0.jpeg) 

  What do you think? If it was such a candidate, would you want it from a technical perspective? 

At least I feel that if I were still responsible for the recruitment of technical positions, I would basically not give interviews, because I have too few technical stacks, and I may have to teach too many things after recruitment. 

This is the reality. It's not that I deliberately attack. If we can't face up to our own shortcomings, it's not just that what I said is a little unpleasant. Society is even more cruel. 

![avatar]( 66a6ba1763a74b6d9aa125d6878d8f1a.jpeg) 

But some people have just graduated, and when they go for an interview, the company is rushing to ask for it. Why is this? 

To put it bluntly, it is technology and experience. Next, I will talk about it. Let's first look at technology, that is, what should we learn if we take the Python direction. 

###  What do you need to learn about Python? 

Python can go in multiple directions, such as crawlers, data analytics, automated testing, back-end development, and artificial intelligence. Since there are many technical points to learn in each direction, I will not explain them one by one. I have made a learning roadmap for each direction. 

It can be said that if you can master 90% of the things on the roadmap, you will have no problem finding a job purely from a technical perspective. 

![avatar]( b6735535d8e5477fb169bf260d355807.png) 

  You can compare the technical points I mentioned with what the senior student has mastered. There is a lot of lack, indicating that his skills are still not in place. 

![avatar]( 4b4af1f623314d16951150b6a5b27768.png) 

This is only a basic level of data analytics should learn, usually with the crawler to find a job is still passable. But if you just want to go data analytics alone, then you have to improve, the direction I wrote in the figure above point 6. 

![avatar]( 2ba3fee59e1a4628bd288b598b9ee08c.png) 

To be honest, Python back-end in the domestic demand is not Java, but the competition will be slightly less, if you want to use Python back-end, I suggest you learn the front-end, it is difficult to go back-end, then full stack. 

The front-end learning roadmap also includes: 

![avatar]( 5f3a3e9f585f4f9eadd6d32c49882394.png) 

![avatar]( 811e8029f12f43f88f775c699bf5dabb.png) 

  Automated tests are also good, they have gradually replaced the old tests, the salary is also good, and the threshold is not that high. 

![avatar]( 1688078d0f0242999a9878f54936873b.png) 

The salary in artificial intelligence is very high, and the future is promising, but the threshold is also very high. If you do not have a graduate degree or have achieved great success in undergraduate studies (such as the top three in the competition), it is basically not recommended for everyone to toss in this direction. 

###  III. How to get companies to rush you 

The above are all technical learning directions. If you want to get a soft interview offer, it is recommended to strengthen the following things, which will be more secure. 

Databases are something that most programmers must master, just like crawlers. When you leave the database, it's a small matter. The vast majority of work collaboration requires the use of databases. 

No matter whether it is SQL or NoSQL, you need to know one. When you are in college, it is recommended to learn MySQL or MongoDB. 

![avatar]( a91602cf721149b689fd86e06abca2e3.jpeg) 

Make sure to do projects to practice. It's not enough to list the technology stacks you know, but there is something to prove that you have mastered them. 

The project can be used for reference, but it is not to change the soup without changing the medicine, but to directly change the quantity and run it? Of course not, you have to think about it thoroughly, and then upgrade it to make it have more practical functions. 

For a simple example, if you create a website that starts by displaying text and images, and you figure it out, can you add a chat function to it? Or can you try to allow others to sign up for concurrent articles? Even if you can use a recommendation algorithm to make it recommend according to user preferences, then the upgrade is successful. 

There are not many projects, just do one or two that can be done. 

Just came out of school, or just transferred from other industries to the IT industry, be sure to look for a job with a learning mindset. Don't expect too much salary at the beginning. Mainly focus on learning technology and project experience. After a year, you can look at job-hopping. After settling, your salary will definitely increase a lot. 

###  IV. Summary 

Finally, let me summarize for you: 

>  1. Technology must be deeply drilled, not a little bit of everything, it is best to learn in a certain direction.. 2. If the things taught in school are not deep enough, then extend them by yourself. To put it bluntly, university is the teacher who leads the door, and the practice depends on the individual.. 3. Be sure to add shining points to yourself, such as being proficient in databases and having projects that you can do well.

###  foreword 

It can be said that many people learn programming, and it is indeed a lot less interesting to not play with crawlers. Whether it is amateur, private work or professional crawlers, the crawler world is indeed quite exciting. 

Today, I will give you a brief talk about reptiles, with the aim of enabling friends who are ready to learn reptiles or who are just starting out to have a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of reptiles. 

Even if you haven't learned about crawlers, you can still understand the principles of crawlers after reading this article! 

![avatar]( 91d7d6f79869466bb4723831776f29de.jpg) 

###  First, get to know reptiles 

Let me introduce you to the famous crawler in one sentence: an automated program that requests websites and extracts data. 

In simple terms, what can a crawler do? It can help you automatically download a large amount of text, pictures, videos, audio, etc. from a website, without you having to manually operate them one by one. 

According to the usage scenario, crawlers can be divided into three categories: 

General-purpose crawlers (large and comprehensive) have powerful functions and a wide range of collection surfaces, and are usually used in search engines. For example, Baidu Browser is a large crawler program. 

Focused crawlers (small and precise) have relatively simple functions, only crawling specific content for specific websites, such as going to a website to obtain certain data in batches, which is also the most commonly used crawler for us personally. 

③ Incremental crawler (only collects updated content) This is actually an iterative crawler that focuses on crawlers. It only collects updated data and does not collect old data. It is equivalent to always existing and running. As long as there is data that meets the requirements, it will automatically crawl new data. 

![avatar]( d09e742346404877922be58300d02665.jpg) 

There is a protocol called Robots that needs to be paid attention to in crawlers, also known as "web crawler exclusion standards". Its function is to tell you what can and cannot be crawled by websites. 

Where can I look at this Robots protocol? Under normal circumstances, you can directly add/robots.txt after the homepage URL of the website to view it. 

>  For example, Baidu's Robots protocol is https://www.baidu.com/robots.txt, you can see that there are many URLs that cannot be crawled.

For example, Disallow:/shifen/means that the subdirectory pages under Disallow:/shifen and Disallow:/shifen cannot be crawled. 

![avatar]( dcd3d7b7153c41d18f622ee6d79941c2.png) 

  In fact, this Robots agreement belongs to a gentleman's agreement. For crawlers, it is basically a verbal agreement. If you violate it, you may be held legally responsible, but if you do not violate it, crawlers will not be able to crawl any data. Therefore, both parties usually turn a blind eye and don't be too arrogant. 

![avatar]( afda73d38b7d4f7dab59982cd0716d40.jpg) 

###  Second, the basic process of crawlers 

How do crawlers work? A crawler program can be roughly divided into four steps: 

① Initiate a request, make a request to the target site through the HTTP library, that is, send a Request, the request can contain additional headers and other information, and wait for the server to respond. 

② Get the response content. If the server can respond normally, it will get a Response. The content of the Response is the page content to be obtained, and the types may include HTML, Json string, and binary data (such as images and videos). 

③ Parse the content, the resulting content may be HTML, which can be parsed with regular expressions and web page parsing libraries. It may be Json, which can be directly converted to Json object parsing, and may be binary data, which can be saved or further processed. 

④ Save data, there are many styles of saved data, which can be saved as text, saved to a database, or saved as a file in a specific format. 

So that's basically the four steps that a crawler has to follow. 

Request and Response are the most important parts of a crawler. What is the relationship between Request and Response? The relationship between the two is as follows: 

![avatar]( 3eac43fa1c8642539c38020a54516f85.jpg) 

  Briefly understand: 

>  When we search for something on the computer's browser, such as the aforementioned search for "Python" on Baidu, you click on Baidu and send a Request request to Baidu's server. Request contains a lot of information, such as identity information, request information, etc. After the server receives the request, it makes a judgment and then returns a Response to our computer, which also contains a lot of information, such as whether the request was successful or not, such as the information results we requested (text, pictures, videos, etc.). 

This should be easy to understand, right? Next, let's take a closer look at Request and Response. 

###  III. Understanding the Request 

What does Request contain? It mainly includes the following things: 

The request method can be understood as the way you greet a website. If you want to get data from a website, you have to greet it in the correct way so that it can respond to you. 

Just like if you want to borrow something from someone's house, you have to knock on the door first to say hello, and you can directly climb through the window to enter. Anyone who sees it has to be kicked out for you. 

![avatar]( bf7bf87ba69f4633aea4f614a96ea043.gif) 

The main request methods include GET and POST, as well as HEAD/PUT/DELETE/OPTIONS and other methods. The most commonly used request method is GET. 

What is a URL? The full name of a URL is Uniform Resource Locator. For example, a web page document, picture, video, etc. has a unique URL. In crawlers, we can understand it as a URL or a link. 

What is a request header? The English name Request Headers usually refers to the header information contained in the request, such as User-Agent, Host, Cookies, and so on. 

These things are equivalent to your identity information when you send a request to a website. It is often necessary to disguise yourself as an ordinary user to prevent your target website from recognizing that you are a crawler, avoid some anti-theft problems, and obtain data smoothly. 

The official version is the additional data carried in the request, such as the form data when the form is submitted. 

How to understand? For example, if you go to your father-in-law's house to propose marriage, you can't go there empty-handed to propose marriage, right? You have to bring something to make it look like a proposal, and your father-in-law will betroth your daughter to you. This is a common etiquette and is indispensable. 

![avatar]( 0d9b1f08eb1144fd9f2cd48182b82e17.jpg) 

For example, on certain pages, you have to log in first or you have to tell me what you are requesting. For example, if you search for "Python" on Baidu's webpage, then the keyword "Python" is the request body you want to carry. Only when you see your request body will Baidu know what you want to do. 

Of course, the request body is usually used in the POST request method. In the GET request, we usually splice it in the URL. Here, you can understand it first, and subsequent specific crawlers can deepen their understanding. 

Since we have already talked about the theory of Request, we can go to practice to see where the Request is and what it contains. 

Take Google Chrome Chrome as an example, I enter the keyword "Python" to search for a bunch of results, let's use the console window that comes with the web page to analyze the Request request we sent. 

Press and hold F12 or right-click "Check" in the blank space of the webpage, and then you can see that there are many options in the console. For example, there is a menu bar in the upper column. For primary crawlers, we usually use Elements (elements) and Network (networks) more commonly. Other things are temporarily unavailable. When you learn advanced crawlers, you will use them. For example, when JS is reversed, you may use the Application window. Later, you will learn more about it. 

Elements contains every element of all request results, such as the source code for each image, especially when you click the small arrow in the upper left corner, every place you move to will be displayed under the Elements window. 

![avatar]( aa615005ebc54e7b94cb03291946e34b.png) 

Network is the network information commonly used by crawlers, including our Request. Let's take a look. Under the Network window, check Disable cache and click All. 

![avatar]( 72f22cca45314a1980f52bbc7e14eae3.png) 

Refresh the webpage to see the effect. It can be seen that we sent 132 Request requests. There is no need to be curious about this. Although we only sent a "Python" request to Baidu, some of them were requests attached to the webpage. 

![avatar]( b996faab01814662b6ea45e068af0d32.png) 

Although there are many types, such as png, jpeg, and so on, you can swipe to the top. In the Type column, there is a document type, which means web document. Click to enter and get our Request information. 

![avatar]( 1880f8417100403bb627892cd4db8d16.png) 

After clicking on document to enter, there is a new menu bar. Under the Headers column, we can see the Request URL, which is the request URL we mentioned earlier. This URL is the URL we actually request from the webpage. Then there is the request method, which can be seen as the GET request method. 

![avatar]( 5f766040932f42eab333809e9863d0c2.png) 

Swipe down again, and you can also see the Request Headers we talked about earlier. There is a lot of information, but the User-Agent, Host, and Cookies we talked about earlier are all available. These are the information we give to the server. 

![avatar]( 9153afba20f24b0cbb2e0569478e3bd9.png) 

Although there is a lot of content in Request Headers, we also need to do camouflage work in this regard when writing a crawler program, but not all the information we have to write, just write some important information selectively, such as User-Agent must bring, Referer and Host are selective zones, cookies will be brought in the case of login, and there are only 4 commonly used items to be camouflaged. 

As for the request body, I will not check it for the time being, because our request method here is a GET request, and the request body can only be viewed in the POST request. It doesn't matter. You will naturally understand when the crawler uses it. 

###  IV. Understanding the Response 

Response mainly includes three pieces of content, let's take a look at them one by one. 

After we send a request, the website will return us a Response, which includes the response status code. The response status can be roughly divided into the following categories: 

>  ① 200 range, such as the response status code 200, indicates success.

② 300 range, such as 301 indicates a jump.

③ 400 range, such as 404 page not found.

④ 500 range, such as 502 pages cannot be found. 

For crawlers, two or three hundred is the response state we most want to see, and it is possible to get data. Four or five hundred is basically cold and can't get data. 

For example, when we just sent the previous Request request, in the document file, we can see that the response status code is 200 in the General under the Headers window, indicating that the webpage successfully responded to our request. 

![avatar]( 1ebac61f45244a4d823831c8ec222d57.png) 

The information the server gives us will also contain a response header, which includes content type, content length, server information, and setting cookies, among others. 

In fact, the response head is not that important to us. Let's take a look here. 

This is very important, in addition to the response state of the first point, because it contains the content of the requested resource, such as web page HTML and image binary numbers, etc. 

Where is the response body? It is also in the Response column in the document file. You can swipe down to see that there is a lot of response data in it. This is the data we have obtained. Some can be downloaded directly, while others require technical analysis to obtain. 

![avatar]( b7069ed3bbcf4736bd6153b6e3a0f81b.png) 

###  What kind of data can crawlers obtain? 

What kind of data can crawlers obtain? Basically, it can be divided into the following categories: 

>  Web documents, such as HTML documents, Json format text, etc.

② Picture, what you get is a binary file, just save it in picture format.

③ Video, which is also a binary file, can be saved as a video format.

④ Others, anyway, other things that can be seen can theoretically be obtained by crawlers, depending on the difficulty. 

###  How to parse the data? 

After the request is successfully sent, the webpage will return a lot of data to us, including thousands or even tens of thousands of codes. How can we find the data we want in so many codes? Common methods include the following: 

>  ① Direct processing. When the data returned by the webpage is some text, which is the content we want. There is no need for filtering processing, just process it directly.

② Json parsing. If the webpage returns not HTML data but Json data, then Json parsing technology is required.

③ Regular expression. If the returned data is data that conforms to the regular expression, you can use the regular to parse.

④ Other parsing methods. Commonly used are XPath, BeautifulSoup, and PyQuery, which are commonly used parsing libraries by crawlers. 

###  How to save the data? 

After obtaining the data, there are several commonly used methods for saving the data: 

>  ① Text. Can be directly saved as plain text, EXCEL, Json, Xml and other types of text.

② Relational database. Data can be saved to relational databases such as MySQL and Oracle.

③ NoSQL database. Such as MongoDB, Readis and Key-Value storage.

④ Binary files. Such as pictures, videos, audio, etc. can be directly saved to a specific format. 

Regarding crawlers, let's talk about it here today. Welcome to leave a message in the comment area below. 

###  Conclusion 

Whether the reptile is a double-edged sword, used to "chop melons and vegetables" or "hurt people's lives", it is entirely up to the user's mind, and I hope everyone can use the reptile reasonably. 

Of course, if your skills are poor, it's impossible for you to do anything out of the ordinary. 

Thank you for reading and liking. I have collected a lot of technical dry goods that can be shared with friends who like my articles. If you are willing to take the time to study, they will definitely help you. The dry goods include:

A few days ago, a brother who liked to buy funds was worried about how to buy funds. He had no tools and no skills. He was afraid of being harvested as a chive when he entered the fund group, but he felt itchy if he didn't buy it. After buying it for more than ten years, it was risky to choose by himself... 

Looking at one of his notebooks, he wrote a lot of things densely, all about fund analysis. It was not easy at a long age, so he decided to help him. After talking to him in detail about buying funds (because I didn't understand this), according to his request, I used Python to directly select the good fund he wanted to buy. 

In the past few days, he specially came to my house to thank me, and he also specially mentioned 2 bottles of wine, because in the list of funds I screened for him, the funds he bought after selecting have already made a profit, and some of the principal is still left in it.

Today, I will share with you how to choose a good fund with Python, hoping to help some friends who like to buy funds. 

###  I. development environment

 ###  

###  Steps 

1. Obtain fund ranking information and use the four-four-three rule to screen the top-ranked funds 

There are fund rankings on Tiantian Fund Network, which can be crawled and screened with a Python crawler. The four, four, three, three rule is to select funds that rank in the top quarter in 3 years/2 years/1 years and in the top third in 6 months/3 months. 

![avatar]( e0a9e8ebb18c7d3348522e8b01c9cdaf.png) 

The return value is as follows: 

![avatar]( 63da4754837944840b83433aae797d1a.png) 

Tips: The above content actually only needs the value after datas. In this example, you can see that there are 5053 funds in the last year. Then a quarter of the ranking is 25% * 5053 = 1263 funds. (The return data has been sorted from high to low, and the top n funds can be extracted.) 

![avatar]( adc229057e74bd8dc838b264e64b38a6.png) 

![avatar]( 25abce1bb685e675a7da0347e2f69133.png) 

This extracts the data. Of course, only part of it. You need to loop to complete the data. The data in dataframe is like this. 

![avatar]( 20fa73912da6284ffffb9dd111470dfc.png) 

2. Obtain the basic information and Sharpe ratio of funds online, and screen out funds with high Sharpe ratio. 

A total of 171 funds were selected through the rule of four, four, three, three. Continued screening is required. The goal is to select 20 funds from 171 funds. The rule is funds with a high Sharpe ratio with more than 100 million funds. 

Also get the capital scale and Sharpe ratio from Tiantian Fund Network. The URL is as follows:

Splice the above two dataframes 

![avatar]( 6207b0c802870b24766b350ef1b1b59f.png) 

Multiply the 3-year/2-year/1-year/6-month/3-month ranking by the weight (0.3/0 25/0.2/0.15/0) to calculate the comprehensive ranking and sort it. Take the top 50 data. 

![avatar]( f2059199c0078521f4aadaf032f658cc.png) 

Take the top 20. 

![avatar]( b6486f74c1dafbc0213dd612e33199d7.png) 

Export to csv format file (Excel-like file)

![avatar]( 53caa5b2e8b47bd3b505b1d1b508e4cc.png) 

After the above steps, the best list of the top 20 funds was successfully selected. I wish you all the best. 

However, I still have to remind everyone that this is only more time-saving, labor-saving and slightly more accurate than manual analysis and judgment, but it is not ruled out that the data will also deceive people. It is difficult to say that what you see is arranged by others. Investment is risky, and you need to be cautious when entering the market.

This is the end of the article. Thank you for watching. I just have something to say to my readers. 

I have been learning how to write articles since I retired. To be honest, every time I see some readers' responses in the background, I feel very relieved. I am a newcomer to self-media, and I am still a middle-aged uncle. To thank the readers, I would like to contribute some of my collection of programming dry goods to you and give back to every reader. I hope it can help you. 

Dry goods mainly include: 

① More than 2,000 Python e-books (both mainstream and classic books should be available) 

② Python standard library information (the most complete Chinese version) 

③ Project source code (40 or 50 interesting and classic practice projects and source code) 

④ Videos on Python basics, crawling, web development, and big data analytics (suitable for Xiaobai learning) 

⑤ Python learning roadmap (bid farewell to undercurrent learning) 

If you can use it, you can take it away directly. In my QQ technical exchange group (technical exchange and resource sharing, advertising will break your legs), you can take it away by yourself. The group number is 553274211.

I have an uncle who likes to buy funds very much, because he doesn't want to be cut off, so he didn't enter any group, and he carefully selected them all. 

Looking at one of his notebooks densely written a lot of things, all of which were fund data analytics, it was not easy at a long age, so I decided to help him. 

After talking to him in detail about the situation of buying a fund (because I don't understand this), according to his request, I used Python to directly select the good fund he wanted to buy. 

In the past few days, he specially came to my house to thank me, and he also specially mentioned 2 bottles of wine, because in the list of funds I screened for him, the funds he bought after selecting have already made a profit, and some of the principal is still left in it.

If you also have friends who like to buy funds or stocks, you can also provide them with some technical support in this way. 

###  First, the goal 

The purpose is to select the top 20 funds that meet the current conditions from Tiantian Fund Network. I will clarify the specific screening conditions in the following steps.

###  Conclusion 

Remind the following everyone that this is only more time-saving, labor-saving and accurate than manual analysis and judgment. After obtaining the data, you must have professional knowledge to analyze it before you can get the answer.

Sometimes we have to free our hands and let the computer automatically send us some of the messages we want to send, which is very labor-saving. For example, after writing a speech during the day and giving a text speech in the group at night, we can use the script to automatically copy, paste, and send text, thus freeing ourselves from having to do the hard work of Ctrl C/Ctrl V repeatedly on the computer. 

You can also send the specified content after the scheduled time, so you don't have to sit in front of the computer to send bullet comments. 

![avatar]( 90f34a3eb6884d0a84c82fe6b94a7f35.jpg) 

How often to send 1 message, or how many messages to send in 1 second, can be set freely. If the time is set short, it is no problem to send dozens of messages a second, but too fast will form the effect of swiping the screen... 

Today, I will share this trick with you. It is very simple and there is not much code. 

###  First, the effect 

Let's take a look at the effect first. What I set here is to start sending after 4s, and send it every 0.5s. 

Use Python to realize the automatic sending of messages by the computer, and the content can be customized, either fast or slow. 

###  The development environment 

###  III. Analysis of key steps 

There are two main code files to achieve, the purpose is: to obtain the location of the chat window and to achieve the automatic sending of messages. The libraries used have been mentioned above. Before starting to write code, first download and install the libraries to be used. This will not be discussed below. 

Before we send a message, we need to know where the chat window is located, that is, where the mouse stays to locate the input interface of the chat window, that is, what are the x and y coordinates of the mouse. 

Here I use the three libraries os, time, and pyautogui to obtain the real-time position of the mouse: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574525967
 ```  
As long as the program is running, every time we move the mouse, the mouse's x and y values will automatically sound and change and print out. We only need to call up the chat window and position the mouse at the input position of the chat window to obtain the current x and y values. With this x and y value, we can tell the following messaging program where to paste and push. 

![avatar]( ae6dd97eafea4d6699d93e57aa522c31.gif) 

  Of course, there are many ways to obtain the mouse position, and you can also try other methods to obtain it. 

>  Fan benefits, click to view 

After obtaining the values of x and y, what we need to do is, of course, to write a program to achieve "copy text → paste text → send messages". Here, we need to use pyautogui to control the keyboard and mouse, use pyperclip to control the computer to copy and paste, and use the time library to control the time. 

First of all, we prepare the content that needs to be sent in advance and put it in the content. At that time, we can use it directly. The content can be customized and modified, such as this: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574525967
 ```  
We need to switch to the chat interface after running the code, and it takes time to do this manually. Therefore, before copying and pasting and sending the code, we need to set aside some time for ourselves. I have set a time lag of 4s here, and of course, we can also set it to start sending messages after a few hours. 

 ```python

 ```  
The next step is how to implement copy, paste and send:

At this point, everything is done. If you feel that 5s is sending 1 message too fast, you can modify the value of 5 in time.sleep (5), for example, 10s sends a message; if you set it to 0.01 seconds, then it will be a quick message swipe effect... 

The "* 10" in the for loop controls the number of loops, that is, let it send text 10 times, or you can set it not to loop, and change the list (content.split ("\ n")) * 10 to content.split ("\ n"). 

The general method is the above. If you need the source code, you can chat with me privately. You can also try other ways to achieve it. To put it bluntly, it is to automatically send messages. There are many ways to achieve it, such as more advanced ones that directly bring xookie to adjust the API to send, etc., and the button wizard can also achieve this function. More exciting, waiting for you to dig it yourself. 

###  summarize 

The essence of this script is to automatically send messages to the computer, but the setting of the interval makes it also have the function of sending messages quickly, not only QQ, but also WeChat. 

The basic principle is this. You can also think about how to start the program after a few hours and send it every few minutes to completely free yourself.

Recently, I received feedback from fans that I had not completed the basics of Python after learning for a month. I was stunned at the time. Really, when did the basics of Python become so unfathomable? 

As a result, I went to take a look, and it was really "interesting". I just pulled dozens of lessons into two or three hundred lessons, and I also talked about some things that beginners don't need at all. When I was approaching the 300th session, I didn't finish talking about string...

  I won't be named here, anyway, the feeling I get is: from entry to burial, who can finish this?

In fact, there are also Python basic teaching articles in my blog posts. Recently, I have made new adjustments according to the feedback from fans, deleting the traditional and simplifying, and directly giving you pure Python basic teaching. I hope everyone's learning will no longer be useless!

###  Today's content preview 

For beginners learning Python, I suggest installing Python and Pycharm. I will often use these two software when writing code in the future. Both software can be downloaded from the official website. If you don't want to go to the official website to download, I also have a good installation package. After picking it up, you can start the installation process. 

>  Software package download link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BtnMGsfYNFIkmJ26wuGjCw Extraction code: al6e 

The installation of Python can be downloaded directly from the official website. Since it is a foreign website, the response and download speed may be a little slow. If you are not in a hurry, just wait. If you want to be faster, use Xunlei to download quickly. 

![avatar]( ebab87d225aa4df9ab65c9a1555f0a04.png) 

 The download address is ttps://www.python.org/downloads/, or you can enter the download page from the official outlet Downloads, select the corresponding version of your computer, mine is a Windows computer, so just click Windows directly.  

Python is currently out to version 3.11, you can see that there are many versions to choose from to download, I use 3.9.6 this version, and then choose the model according to the computer, my computer is 64-bit, so download 64-bit software, here to remind you, I personally do not recommend installing too new versions, because there may be some libraries or compatibility issues, resulting in an error when running.

- Install Python 

![avatar]( b9fe178e4466486e9ac151b4ad898fbb.png) 

 Double-click the downloaded file to enter the installation interface. Select Custom Install and check both options to install Python into the PATH. This interface does not change, just click Next. Choose a path you want to install, otherwise it will install you to the C drive, I will install it to the D drive, and then click Install. After the installation is complete, click Close. 

![avatar]( 3ec5fbbe35c84f349b451c0651e86841.png) 

To test whether your Python installation is successful, the WIN + R keys bring up the command window and enter cmd.

 ![avatar]( a6b833b0e1c544a1873775623d34dc15.png) 

  Enter Python in the black window, and then press Enter. If you prompt Python 3.9.6 and other information, it means that the installation has been successful. If there is no prompt, go back and see which environment you made a mistake.  

>  I have hidden a lot of technical dry goods and moved them to the CSDN community to pick them up by myself. 

Download from the official website of Pycharm, choose the system, I am a Windows system, so the default remains unchanged, and then download the community version, and then use the professional version when you become stronger. 

![avatar]( 067e7101e9d541809dd96863f987432f.png) 

  After downloading, double-click to start the installation. 

![avatar]( 7e2e949dc591434db59ba46197260a76.png) 

  Click Next. 

![avatar]( 0cd84d74f171400a9db8fcaa7e6e27d6.png) 

  Customize the installation path, it is recommended to install other disks other than the C drive, and click Next.

Check all. 

![avatar]( 5eaa44cfc6274b84aa2fc416216969ca.png) 

  After arriving here, the default is enough, and click Install to start the installation. 

![avatar]( 191c5ac5c0a34f2dac4a618de4b61210.png) 

  After waiting for the installation to be completed, click finish to install it.

We are ready to write our first line of code, the famous Hello World. 

![avatar]( f51043e456f745318e353ff388ff5db9.png) 

 Open Pycharm, click New Project to create a new project, and you can do this for new projects in the future. Open in the middle is to open the project. If you have a written project, you can open it from here.  

The next step is to set the location of the project. If you follow my steps when installing Pycharm, the Base interpreter will automatically detect Python. You can do it without changing it, just click Create in the lower left corner to create it.

  Then click on the left. A pop-up box will pop up when entering the page. Just click Close to close it.  

What we created earlier is a project, which is a folder to store the source code. Here we start to create the source code files. (My computer had some projects before, so there are many folders below, which may not be the same as yours.) 

Click on the email pop-up option python_learn create a good project, select New to create a new one, and select Python File to create a Python source file.

  Then you will be prompted to give your file a name, and then hit enter to complete the creation of the code source file. To start writing code, one of the most commonly used functions, print (), is used to output content. Functions have their syntax. As long as you follow the syntax to write code, the software will know what you want to do. 

The syntax of print is as follows, with a newline by default.

 ```  
Next, we are going to output our first line of code. Hello world is a string. You need to add "" to be the correct format, otherwise an error will be reported. We will discuss the string in detail later. Here, you only need to know that you have to write code in this format to achieve the desired result.

Before you can write code in Python, you must have a basic knowledge of Python, otherwise you may struggle with it. Basic knowledge includes input and output, variables, data types, expressions, and operators. 

Python has many functions, which we will discuss in detail later, but here are the two most basic functions: input and output. 

The output function print (), which we have used before, has the following syntax: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
The input function is input (), the function is to receive user input, and the syntax is: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Example: Receive a password entered by a user and print it 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
In Python, "#" indicates a comment, and the things after "#" will not be executed. After the code runs, "Please enter your password:" appears first, and then enter it at will, such as entering 123, and the execution result: 

 ```python

 ```  
Successfully receives user input and prints it out. 

A variable is a name that needs to be assigned before use. Variables must conform to the naming convention of identifiers (names). This is a hard requirement. Identifiers are equivalent to names, including variable names, function names, class names, etc. 

>  Keywords: if while for as import reserved words: input, print range 

>  1. Package name: all lowercase, such as time;

  2. Class name: the first letter of each word is uppercase, other lowercase, short for big hump naming, such as HelloWorld;

  3. Variable name/function name: the first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of the following word is uppercase, which is abbreviated as a small hump name, such as helloWorld;

  4. Constants: all caps, such as Hello.

Data types can be divided into the following six categories: 

 ```python

 ```  
When writing code, we often need to convert different data types. The main data type conversion methods are as follows: 

(1) string to integer 

The method is int (str), and the string must be a number, for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
(2) Floating point type to integer type 

The method is int (float), for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
(3) string to float, the method is float (str), the string must be the sum of numbers, for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
(4) Integer type to floating point type, the method is float (int), for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
The floating-point string method is str (float), for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Here, regardless of the nesting of the print () and type () functions, we will run the result as long as we know that they are outputting the data type of ff: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
(6) The integer to string method is str (int), for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
(1) The type () syntax is type (object), which returns the type of the object. We have also used it before, but it is returned internally. If you don't output it, you can't see it, so it is often nested with the output function print (). 

Example: Get the data type and output it. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Class means type, and it can be seen that f is data of type int. 

(2) isinstance () isinstance () is often used to determine the data type, it returns a boolean value (True or False), and the syntax is isinstance (object, class). 

Example: Determine whether 30.5 is an integer. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
In Python, expressions are combinations of numbers, operators, numeric group symbols (parentheses), variables, and other objects called expressions. Expressions have fixed literal values. For example, the value of the expression "10 + 20" is 30, and the value of the expression "10 > 30" is False. 

Operators can be divided into four categories. 

(1) General Operators 

>  +，-，*，/（ true division),//(floor division, fractional part is rounded),% (remainder), ** (exponentiation) 

(2) Assignment operator 

>  The commonly used assignment operator is =, and the value to the right of the equal sign is assigned to the left of the equal sign 

>  Enhanced assignment operator ：+=，-=，*=，/=,%=,**=

 ```  
>  Continuous assignment: a = b = c = d = 10 

(3) Boolean arithmetic 

>  == (equal to),! = (not equal to ） >= <= > < 

(4) Logical operators 

>  There are three main categories: not, and and or, also known as non, and or and: if both before and after are true, it is true or: if one is true, it is true not: not true, not false

Flow control is commonly used in the if/else statement of the conditional branch process and the while statement of the loop control. 

Code that only triggers when certain conditions are met. 

(1) Grammar 1 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
The Boolean expression has only two results, either true or false. If it is true, then the code block in the if statement is executed, otherwise it is skipped. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
From this, it can be seen that the boolean expression (a < b) in the first if statement is true, so the code block print ("true") inside is executed, while the boolean expression (a > b) in the second if statement is false, so the code block inside is not executed, so the word "false" is not output. 

(2) Syntax 2 The commonly used if/else statement has the following syntax: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
The logic of the judgment is that if the boolean expression is true, the code block inside the if is executed, and if it is false, the code inside the else is executed. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553

 ```  
The function of the flow control statement we talked about earlier is still relatively limited. For example, it can only be executed once, and it is a bit troublesome to write a few more to execute multiple times. Therefore, we need to learn the loop statement in the loop process. Its function is to run some code repeatedly. 

(1) While cycle 

Grammar: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
The code block inside is executed as long as the condition (Boolean expression) is true. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
After running, you can enter the score multiple times and never stop. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Of course, there is a drawback here. After the code is executed, it falls into an infinite loop, while the code inside is executed all the time, because 4 < 5 is always true. 

So here we can improve the code, don't let it execute forever, let it loop a few times on it, here you can use a variable as a condition to judge, change 4 < 5 to a < 5, and let the self-adding function be implemented in the while. Every time the code is executed in the while, when it is executed to its line, it adds 1, so that it will jump out when it is executed twice.

 ```  
Here I will give you another example to understand the use of the while loop. For example, enter an integer and calculate the sum of each bit, for example, enter 321, then the sum of each bit is 6. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
I entered 2345, and the execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
(2) The for loop and the while loop are both loop statements, but the difference is that the for loop is a technical loop. 

Grammar: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Execute: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
L is a list. We will talk about it later. There are three elements in the list. Every time a for loop is executed, the elements in the list will be assigned to n. Until there are no elements in the list to assign, n will jump out of the list. At this time, the for loop will not be established and the code block in the for will not be executed. 

(3) The range for loop is often used with range, which is an iterable object. The syntax of range is as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
The start value is the start subscript. All elements in the range sequence have subscripts, and the subscript of the first element is 0, so the default is 0. 

Stop is the end position. The end position subscript is (number of elements -1). For example, if there are 4 elements in the range, the end subscript is up to 3, and if it is greater than 3, it will jump out of the range. 

Step is the step size. If step is 2, then each element will be separated by 1. The default step size is 1, that is, each element will be fetched. 

Example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
From the first for loop, it can be seen that the subscript of the first element of range () starts from 0, not from 1; range () can not write the start subscript and step size, but must have an end position; the second for loop can see that the step size can be negative, used for decrement. 

(4) The function of continue continues is to skip this loop and continue the execution of subsequent loops, for example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Execution result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
Obviously, when i is equal to 5, the for loop is skipped, and the code inside is no longer executed this time, returning to a new loop. 

Similarly, there is also the function of terminating all loops, that is, break, which is the same usage as continue, but the effect is different. I will not give an example here. You can try it and find out. 

Lists can hold any data, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, etc., and are one of the commonly used data types. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574519553
 ```  
The list is subscripted, and the subscript starts from 0. Elements refer to each data in the list. For example, there are 5 elements in l = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], but the subscript of 5 is 0, and the subscript of 1 is 4.

The list can also hold multiple lists, such as the list [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], which is composed of a list of two dimensions, one dimension is itself, and the other dimension is the three lists [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], so it constitutes a two-bit list. 

For a binary list, the syntax is:

When writing code, we often need to write documentation. We have mentioned that #and three quotation marks can be used to comment the code, but here we want to introduce a new method, which is also a commonly used function documentation format when writing code: In the first line of the function body, use “”" “”" to document, which is a standardized function documentation. 

For example:

The function defined inside a function is called an inline function (or an inner function), and the scope of the inner function: from the beginning of the definition to the end of the code block contained to him cannot perform operations such as a += 1, a = a + 1 in the inner function. The solution is nonlocal and global.

Closures are an important syntax structure of functional programming. 

Programming paradigm: A programming paradigm that refines and abstracts code to make it more reusable 

If the inner function calls a local variable of the outer function, and the outer function returns the function object (function name) of the inner function, for example: 

![avatar]( a28ccbfa7d404a828b7baae6db1ea003.png) 

  This results in closures, which can pass fewer parameters and more arguments - safer, more indirect access to internal functions, such as:

  Of course, closures are conditional.

After learning these basics, what do you think of your level? Did you just float over like this? To be honest, there are not many things you can do after learning these basics. The fun things can only be made after getting started. 

But here in Uncle Long, there are still comprehensive projects. According to the basic knowledge of loops, lists, functions, etc., as I mentioned above, you can try to write a comprehensive project to test your knowledge. You can try to write a simple business card management system. 

The article is already a bit long, so I won't talk about it too much. If you are interested, you can go to my article to take a look at this simple project:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason for writing this article is that I have received no less than 10 fans recently asking me what book to buy in Python, especially when I saw that some fans actually bought this book "Python Programming Practice" as an introductory Python book for beginners. After seeing it, I couldn't help but be stunned... 

![avatar]( f133f5e89ee1ab49a916ddb80be9992b.png) 

It's not that this book is rubbish. I have also read this book. The book is not very thick, and it can be read in a few days. It talks about some very basic knowledge, and some places are very jumping, and it is not explained clearly. I think with this money, you can buy higher quality and more suitable books, and the harvest will never be less than this one. 

After working for more than 20 years, I have read more than 200 technical books myself. Now there are more than 50 books that I personally like in the study at home, and I will read them from time to time. Reading books has become a habit that I have maintained over the years. 

In order to enable more people who want to learn Python by reading books to spend their money on the cutting edge, I have summarized all the popular Python books that I personally think are cost-effective and worth reading. Today, I will share with you some of the best books. Some of them are no worse than the current paid courses on the market. 

###  Getting Started with Python 

![avatar]( 0fc914a550333f5ecc597e8c5064fdb4.png) 

If you are a beginner learning Python, I recommend this book "Python Programming From Introduction to Practice". It is a very small white book with friendly content and no esoteric knowledge points. The explanation is in place, allowing small white to quickly understand Python and enjoy the confidence and interest brought by programming. 

This book is divided into two parts: basic knowledge and project practice. First, you learn the basics of Python step by step, and then through the practical training of high-quality projects, you can develop your programming thinking, analyze the skills and angles of problems, and definitely benefit a lot. 

This book is based on Python 3, and there is no problem with this book as an introductory book. Python's common application fields are also included. After learning the basics, if you want to expand to a specific application field, then you can go to the specific application field book. 

###  Second, the direction of web crawlers 

![avatar]( c9f3cde43ecf417fb9208c6b7f7833e6.png) 

If you are a beginner with zero foundation or a relatively weak foundation and want to learn from crawlers, I recommend the book "Python Programming Quick Start, Second Edition". 

This book mainly talks about the basics of Python, web crawlers, and automated office (Excel/word/PDF). It is very suitable for novice beginners to go in the direction of web crawlers, because web crawlers are not only front-end data capture, but also back-end data storage and processing. Otherwise, if you climb down a lot of messy data, your scalp will be numb, so the addition of automated office can make web crawlers even more powerful. 

At the end of each chapter, there are some exercises and in-depth practical projects to help readers consolidate their knowledge. The appendix provides the answers to all the exercises, which can be said to be a rare masterpiece for learning about crawlers. 

![avatar]( f7e7ec0ae77a9fd33cecd802ac52683a.png) 

If you are a Python-based learner who wants to develop into a crawler, then you can check out the book "Python Web Data Collection". 

This book is specifically about web crawlers, and it goes straight to the point. Therefore, it is not suitable for beginners with zero or weak foundation, but more suitable for people who have learned Python to read. It will save you a lot of time and effort, and it is not thick, only about 200 pages. The extended version of this practical book not only introduces web crawling, but also serves as a comprehensive guide to crawling almost all types of data from the modern web.

###  III. Direction of data analytics 

![avatar]( ef2220c7c30ffd126a8b3195c33e86b4.png) 

In the field of data analytics, if you have a foundation in Python, I recommend the book "Data Analytics with Python". 

Those who have come into contact with data analytics know our commonly used Pandas. This book happened to be written by the founder of the Pandas project. It details the specific details and basic points of using Python to manipulate, process, clean, and organize data. It covers pandas, NumPy, IPython, and Jupyter, and adds a large number of practical cases to help you solve a series of data analytics problems efficiently. 

Last year, when I read the second edition of this book, I felt its enhancement, but the fly in the ointment is that the second edition of this book has some errors in translation, which is a bit worse than the first edition. I don't know if there is a revised version now. If you have the ability, I suggest reading the English version, because this book is really strong in data analytics. 

![avatar]( 3ca076b44c2f6fe72fb7ff7609bf3d86.png) 

If you are a novice with zero or weak foundation in Python, you can start with this "Python Data Analytics Fundamentals Tutorial". 

This is a book published by People's Publishing House last year. It tells readers a lot about the basics of Python and the introduction of data. It is very friendly for beginners, and it is also a project exercise with chapters. In the key part of this article, it focuses on the specific operation of NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and machine learning library scikit-learn, and there are several good real projects. 

It can be said that it is a rare good book from zero foundation to proficiency in data analytics, but is it suitable for people with a foundation to read this book? Of course, there is no need to read it. You can read its second edition, which will save a lot of time by starting directly with NumPy. 

###  IV. Front-end development direction 

For the front-end essential HTML and CSS, I personally don't think there is a need to read books. The two newly added points are really fast and numerous. Just by looking at which book you may have to abandon learning new technical points shortly after you learn it. Generally speaking, it is enough to master the basics. There are many resources on the Internet to learn the basics, such as Cainiao tutorials and so on. 

In addition to HTML and CSS, there are many points involved in front-end, such as AJAX, etc., but the indispensable one is our JS. Regarding JS, I personally have to recommend one of the best-known red books in the industry. 

![avatar]( 8a3ee65efbbcd13a4b7ebd03170675d1.png) 

This "JavaScript Advanced Programming" is also known as the Red Treasure Book. This book is more friendly to beginners than the Rhino Book "The Definitive Guide to JavaScript". The Rhino Book is more like a dictionary-style book, which is a bit boring and difficult to understand. However, the Red Treasure Book is more gentle and easy to understand, and it takes you to understand JS from simple to deep. 

Red Treasure Book has also released its 4th edition, which also adds a lot of things, such as mobile end detection, rich text editor, html5, etc. It may not be a quick book, but it will definitely give you a comprehensive JS knowledge sedimentation. 

This book is relatively thick, with more than 800 pages and a wide range of coverage. It will take a long time to read, but it is not the end. It is a book that is very suitable for collection and repeated reading. 

###  V. Back-end development direction 

![avatar]( f14982649e6dbf39d68e534edca6ce65.png) 

Many people who do website design do not really understand HTTP, here is a recommended "Illustrated HTTP" book, this book can not only understand the HTTP protocol, the most interesting is in the second half of the book to see how the HTTP protocol based on stateless simple protocol, to solve the technical challenges brought by the new interaction pattern. 

This book is suitable for web development engineers, including front-end and back-end, as well as readers at all levels who are interested in the HTTP protocol. It is not only easy to understand, but also easy to read, with only 300 pages. 

Database books I recommend two very classic and useful books, one is "SQL must know" and the other is "High-performance MySQL". You can choose one of these two books to read. Choose the corresponding book to read according to your interests or work needs. If you don't know it now, then I think you can read "High-performance MySQL". MySQL is a popular database at the moment, and "High-performance MySQL" is indeed a classic in the database community. It covers all knowledge points, whether it is a DBA or a front-end and back-end developer. I think it is a book worth learning over and over again. 

![avatar]( 13ff228efb5a173e4588fcb144beca9b.png) 

These two books are designed for people with a solid foundation. If your foundation is not good, then go and learn the basics of Python before reading.

###  VI. Automated testing direction 

![avatar]( 6410f74f6d454a8fdb1077902ab8a9dc.png) 

This book is aimed at learners with zero foundation. Before the book, there were many explanations on Python knowledge. Before I read it, it was still the second edition. This book is still very friendly to people who have not been exposed to the field of automated testing. There are a few parts about selenium and a lot of places about automation concepts. However, it is still good as an introductory book. Now it has been published in the third edition. 

For developers with testing experience or a foundation in Python, the book "Pytest Testing Practices" is a good fit. 

![avatar]( 27ff696d90ee2c09c172207cff7e3691.png) 

"Pytest Testing Practice" I personally think is a classic book that test engineers must read. There are many test examples in it, and the use of pytest, especially the use of unique fixtures, is explained very thoroughly. As the most popular Python testing tool in the industry, it would be a pity to miss it. 

###  VII, machine learning and artificial intelligence 

This book is written by François Chollet, the father of Keras and currently a researcher of Google artificial intelligence. It is a masterpiece and one of the best-known and rare books in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The content is easy to understand. When I read this book, I had never been exposed to the field of machine learning, but I was still able to understand it when I read this book. It can be said to be a good entry. 

![avatar]( a8beb6a38ec1fd6651e8e9d71ea6f30e.png) 

The book basically revolves around Keras to talk about various implementations of deep learning, from CNN, RNN to GAN, etc., which are generally introductory, but also carry many authors' thoughts on the integrity of deep learning. It is worth mentioning that the author recommends using GPU to run the examples in the book. This is no joke. Running with CPU will make you feel very desperate. 

This book I have to make a recommendation, is currently our country's rare machine learning peak, made by Li Hang, compared to Zhou Zhihua's watermelon book "machine learning" is much stronger, watermelon book is really boring, I also did not know where to put it after reading it, but Li Hang's "statistical learning method" I read it many times. 

![avatar]( 92ca2ce5cb2a66632d2f06ed6d4cd4b3.png) 

The mainstream techniques of machine learning are mentioned in the book, and they are streamlined and not verbose. There are no extra diagrams, which give you a clear understanding of the principle. With appropriate examples, it can be said that it is a classic in the statistical learning textbook, and it is currently in the second edition. 

###  Advance in other directions 

The above is to introduce to you the books that I personally think are good in all directions of Python. If you read the books in the direction you are interested in and want to read some advanced books to improve your technical stack, you can start from the following directions. Of course, these directions have jumped out of the scope of Python. 

For programming, in addition to language proficiency, the most important thing is data structures and algorithms. 

![avatar]( 20210529191945340.jpg) 

 In this regard, I recommend the book "Introduction to Algorithms", which is not suitable for beginners because it requires a strong foundation in mathematics and a deep foundation in data structures and algorithms.  

![avatar]( 20210529191959372.jpg) 

 Compared to the previous book, "Algorithms" is more acceptable and should be suitable for most friends who learn data structures and algorithms. This book covers the basic data structures and algorithms very comprehensively, and basically it can become a book for you to learn data structures and algorithms well.  

There is no book that you can change to a higher-paying job after reading it, but if you read it carefully, your thinking will be greatly broadened, which may also improve your thinking, allowing you to think of better ways to solve problems at work 

Although we introduced the book "Illustrated HTTP" in the backend book earlier, TCP/IP is naturally indispensable in computer networking. 

I have always felt that the book "TCP/IP Explained in Detail" is the best book for me to read the TCP/IP protocol stack, although this book is very obscure and classic, so it must be recommended. Of course, there is also a book "Computer Networking, Top Down". Looking at all the books on computer networking, I don't think there is any other better book than them, so you can choose one of them. 

![avatar]( 9b41dd0086aa22c3272ba8fab7593acf.png) 

As we all know, C language development is rarely done on Windows, basically based on Linux operating system, as a good programmer, for Linux understanding is essential. 

![avatar]( 20210529192029658.jpg) 

 First of all, I recommend Brother Bird's "Linux Private Kitchen" to everyone. This book mainly talks about the use of Linux operating system, because it is the main command, which is very suitable for reference books. If you are basically familiar with the content inside, then you must be able to come in handy. You don't need to remember the details, but you need to know which command is for what. It is recommended that you read it again.  

"Linux private kitchen" is only about the use of Linux operating system, but if you want to learn to program on Linux operating system, it is recommended to see this book called "Unix environment advanced programming", C language is better, will not be in Linux operating system programming actual combat, then it is just a toy. 

![avatar]( 20210529192106450.jpg) 

 "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" will cover a lot of practical aspects, such as file IO, multi-threaded programming, networking, sockets, etc., making it very practical and classic.  

Finally, I would like to recommend a book on code quality, which is also the book that has had the greatest impact on me. I have gained a lot of experience and skills from it, "Refactoring and Improving the Design of Existing Code". This book is about the best practice. Of course, you need to have a certain programming foundation. 

![avatar]( 269064c2db6aacf5f3a0ad06e98bd2b7.png) 

###  Conclusion 

I started reading these books when I was working. At that time, I had a regret that I didn't read a few more books when I was studying, especially when the library was free. 

This is one of the books I have read so far about Python and programming. I personally think it is a very good book. Although I have read a lot of technical books, everyone is at a different technical level when they read, so the understanding and judgment of books are also different, but it does not affect the way we look back on the road we have traveled and the books we have read. We all want to leave some better references for those who follow. 

To borrow a famous writer Bing Xin's words to encourage everyone: read well, read more, read good books. 

Some good books on Python or programming languages, in addition to the above, what else have you read? Feel free to leave a comment in the comment area!

##  foreword 

I have written code for more than 20 years, and I have been a senior architect of Ali before. I have stumbled a lot on the road of technology. Today, I will share some of my personal self-learning methods with you. Why do I say: I don't recommend anyone to use C language as a first lesson in programming? 

![avatar]( 7de08c098ed04bf3ba22b75c7ca3039b.png) 

 There are many students here who want to stand up and say: "Uncle Long, I think you are dizzy in this line of work. Didn't the first class of computer majors start with C language?" It is true that no one can shake the status of C language in the programming world as the "father" of many languages today, but why do I still say that it is not recommended that we still use C language for enlightenment in 2023?  

##  The better C is, the worse C is 

When we are beginners, we often hear some people say that this language is not good or that language is the best in the world. This is actually not right. If you look closely, you will find that very few architects will come out and say "XXX language is the best language". Basically, what you see are programmers discussing which language is better and which language is worse. 

Language is just a tool for us programmers, and what we need to do is to solve problems, not to study whose tools are the most awesome. 

![avatar]( ecd1e1ac8eab4a51bd438fe8b0d2c3f7.png) 

 Which language is the most awesome, like Honor of Kings, which hero is the most powerful? There is no most powerful hero, you can use it well, and you can play "top score" in the "qualifying" mode of work.  

C language is good? Of course, it is very good, involving the bottom layer of the computer, allowing you to learn the most detailed and basic, but because it is too basic, if we only need to master a language that can really enhance my quality of life, learning planning, and career, it is far from enough! 

So, in 2023, since C is not recommended as an initiation, which language should I start learning programming in? 

——Python 

##  New "Internet celebrity" Python charm 

![avatar]( 6faa21f294a0465fb8d0c80c83ffb617.png) 

 As a new "Internet celebrity" in computers, I am not surprised that Python has become so popular. For example, it:  

##  summarize 

Having said so much, I still say the same thing. The bottom layer of Python is implemented in C language. If you want to go deep into the computer industry and want to start with the basics and have enough time (after learning C language to be successfully employed for at least 2 years), it is recommended to learn C language first, and then Python. However, if you just want to master a programming language and learn it for 3 months to half a year, you can solve problems in life independently: crawling data, data analytics, and improving work efficiency... I suggest you choose Python! 

![avatar]( 945384bb7d60452b81766ad331a3d62f.png) 

 Just tell everyone what to learn but do not give direction is tantamount to playing hooligans, here is also to share my collection of technical dry goods, you can share with friends who like my articles, if you are willing to take the time to sink your heart to learn, they will definitely help you, dry goods content includes: All the above information I have packaged and uploaded to the CSDN official, click 👇 to get it if you need it!

###  👀foreword 

It is normal for the code to have an exception and report an error, but why handle an exception? 

Due to the existence of exceptions, a large number of red font prompts will appear when the code is running, which is good for programmers. They are used to reporting errors in red, but if you develop something for others to see, then people who do not understand the code will be confused and have a bad impression of the product. 

For example, we often lose a simple webpage, which is actually an abnormality in the execution of the webpage code, but some webpages are still very personalized, and the prompt information may be more user-friendly. For example, CSDN has deleted your favorite articles in the background, causing the code that jumps directly to this interface to fail to execute. The error message at this time is as follows: 

![avatar]( 2efbc66ce5fb4a329dd7c3fd8f70d441.png) 

But some products are not so thoughtful during development, without understanding the user's feelings. As a result, a certain program malfunctions, and users can see a bunch of error codes, causing their popularity to plummet. 

![avatar]( 2474d993e7f24ba698d240a5cc9fd7f5.png) 

First of all, the exceptions mentioned in this article do not refer to teaching you how to make the code not report errors. Code exceptions must be debugged to solve them. This is not our focus here. Today's focus is on optimizing and personalizing where the code may report errors, so that the errors look more harmonious. 

Secondly, this is also an important part of the Python beginner tutorial series, which can lay a good foundation for exception handling in future development. There will always be exceptions in the code, but some exceptions do not seem to violate others. This is all due to having a solid foundation in exception capture. 

![avatar]( d00a27a76e824c4a9f1807f4f93c8086.png) 

###  ⚡First, the definition of an exception 

An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and affects the normal execution of the program. In general, an exception occurs when Python cannot handle the program properly. 

For example, I only wrote one variable a in the code, and when I run the program, pycharm cannot recognize this variable, so an error is reported, indicating an exception. 

![avatar]( 8adc7d465fbd4c0bb2e8ceea29f1a878.png) 

###  🙊Handling of exceptions 

Therefore, we need to master the methods of handling exceptions. There are many ways to handle exceptions. Let's take a look at them one by one. 

It can process the code that may be wrong, and the red font that reports an error after processing will be converted into a short, normal font, which is used as follows: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574520728
 ```  
Example: Direct printing of variable a will generate an error. 

![avatar]( 6c531a7ed4c843c6b2460d778fc0246c.png) 

After tyr-except processing: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574520728
 ```  
Run it again to see the effect: 

![avatar]( 468ad28097274201a57c698debd24f06.png) 

The red error message has become shorter and the color is normal. Does this abnormality seem more comfortable? 

Here, tyr-except does not affect the execution of the code. If your code does not report an error, even if you write tyr-except, it will only execute the try line of code. If there is no error in that line of code, it will not execute the code inside except. 

For example, let's take a normal one: 

![avatar]( 9e011e9756a545d8b5644cbbf33c853a.png) 

This method is similar to the previous try-except writing method, except that an except is added later, which can be used to determine a variety of possible error situations. 

For example, there are two lines of code that might report an error, two different types of exceptions, but don't want it to go viral. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574520728
 ```  
Run result: 

![avatar]( 5b766e0b98924f0abdc82426c29abaee.png) 

Although the error is reported, there is no red. Here, pay attention to the two ways of writing except. 

The try-except writing method is very flexible. We can also use tuples to include exception types that may report errors to avoid writing multiple lines of except, for example: 

![avatar]( 70ff6fd15fe5432db08b0e8ba3ec6205.png) 

If there is no exception, execute the code in else, for example: 

![avatar]( b5048b15d48440da8180452e195a8d67.png) 

No matter whether the code has an exception or not, the code in finally will be executed at the end. For example: 

![avatar]( f310461c763648de917ff645cd8d1d2a.png) 

In fact, you can not add the error type after except, because the system will default that the error behind is of type Exception, which is a top-level class that contains all error types.

###  🙈III. Custom exceptions 

Have you found that when we went to do basic exception capture earlier, we had to write a try-except every time there was a possibility of error. What if there were multiple possible errors? Do we need to write multiple try-except? Or theoretically, the code can run, but I want to set a rule that any behavior that does not meet my rules will cause an exception. For example, if the password length exceeds the length specified by me, I want the program to cause an exception. 

Custom exceptions can be used to raise an exception (throw an exception), which is raised by the keyword raise. 

For example, to simulate the situation where a user enters a password, the password entered by the user cannot be less than 6 digits. Customize an exception to detect whether the password entered by the user meets the regulations. If it does not meet the requirements, an exception will be raised, indicating that the current password length and minimum password length cannot be less than 6 digits.

From the above code, we have used the knowledge of classes and instance objects in the previous object oriented section. If you forget it, please review it quickly. In addition, we also combine the previous try-except and our keyword raise to cause exception capture. 

##  💤Conclusion 

The above is the basic method of exception capture and handling, which can be combined with more knowledge to more flexibly capture and optimize exceptions. Nowadays, it is rare to see products that report errors in code but are presented to users intact, indicating that everyone still attaches great importance to exception handling, so this piece of knowledge is also a must for developers.

###  😏foreword 

When writing code and doing projects in Python, we often need to operate on multiple files. How to import other files in the current source code file? How to operate on other files? This is a common problem, especially for crawlers. Where is the data crawled to? How to call it out when used? 

This involves Python's file manipulation knowledge. We can't always do all the operations on a single source file. This is also a knowledge section that must be mastered.

###  💼First, the definition and operation of the file 

Computer files usually refer to the collection of information stored on the computer's hard disk as a carrier, mainly in the form of video, audio, pictures, and documents, such as executable files.exe, document file.txt, web file.html, and so on.

###  💼Second, the basic operation of the file 

In reality, our operations on files can be roughly summarized as "open → operate (read, delete, modify, etc.) → save → close", which is still the case in Python. Before starting file operations in Python, let's learn a few methods. 

1.open (name, mode) ---- Open file 

This is the Python method of opening a file, which is used to open a file and return a file object. 

Name refers to the file name, which must be written in full. What is written in full? It is to write clearly, storage path + file name + suffix. 

Why do you need to write so much? Because even under the same storage path, there may be more than one file with the same file name. As long as the suffix is different, the computer allows the existence of files with the same name, so if you don't write it all, the computer doesn't know who you are referring to 

Mode is the mode to open the file. The default is r, which is the read-only mode. There are many modes of mode, such as reading, writing, etc., which we will talk about later. 

2. write ("content ") ------ write 

As the name suggests, it is to write content to the file object. 

3.read () ------- read 

To write content to the file, you can write numbers in parentheses or not. If you don't write, the default is to read the entire content. Writing numbers means reading X characters. For example, read (6) reads 6 characters of the file object. 

4. close () ------ close the file 

The method of closing the file, if you do not close the file after the file operation, the file will always be open and operated on, which will consume memory. 

5. Cases 

After understanding these 4 basic methods, let's start with a small case: create a new project, then create a Python file named "file" for writing code, and then we write "hello world" to a .txt file called "file 1" by writing. The code is as follows: 

 ```python

 ```  
As mentioned earlier, the open () method returns a file object, so let's use f to receive it. This is the pre-run interface:

After running:

>  I have a lot of technical dry goods in my private stash, and fans can use them for free (click here). 

After running, a new file named "File 1.txt" is generated, and after opening it, we can see what we entered. When writing, if the file does not exist, one will be created by default. 

Similarly, we can also perform read operations on this file: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526944
 ```  
Run result: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526944
 ```  
This is the most basic file operation process. 

It should be noted here that when open (name, mode) is written at the beginning, mode already determines what operations you can do, that is, if you start writing code with: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526944
 ```  
Then if you want to write () later, an error will be reported, because the r read-only mode is declared in mode, so you do not have write permission. Please pay attention to this. 

6. other modes of operation 

There are many operation modes in mode, let's take a look at them in a table: 

The pointer can be understood as a cursor here. Where it is, your operation begins. 

For example, create a new .txt file named "test", write aaa to it for the first time, and write bbb to it for the second time.

###  🎓Conclusion 

There are actually many methods for files. When using it, you can go to the Internet to check the information to gain a deeper understanding. For example, there are other methods in the os module. We can ctrl + left mouse button to enter the module to view, for example, not only the os module, but also the os.path module is also a more commonly used file operation module. 

Then today's sharing will stop here first. After reading it, you can collect it and practice more, and the file operation will no longer be difficult.
