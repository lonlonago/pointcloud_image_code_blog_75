##  foreword 

I have written code for more than 20 years, and I have been a senior architect of Ali before. I have stumbled a lot on the road of technology. Today, I will share some of my personal self-learning methods with you. Why do I say: I don't recommend anyone to use C language as a first lesson in programming?

 There are many students here who want to stand up and say: "Uncle Long, I think you are dizzy in this line of work. Didn't the first class of computer majors start with C language?" It is true that no one can shake the status of C language in the programming world as the "father" of many languages today, but why do I still say that it is not recommended that we still use C language for enlightenment in 2023?  

##  The better C is, the worse C is 

When we are beginners, we often hear some people say that this language is not good or that language is the best in the world. This is actually not right. If you look closely, you will find that very few architects will come out and say "XXX language is the best language". Basically, what you see are programmers discussing which language is better and which language is worse. 

Language is just a tool for us programmers, and what we need to do is to solve problems, not to study whose tools are the most awesome.

 Which language is the most awesome, like Honor of Kings, which hero is the most powerful? There is no most powerful hero, you can use it well, and you can play "top score" in the "qualifying" mode of work.  

C language is good? Of course, it is very good, involving the bottom layer of the computer, allowing you to learn the most detailed and basic, but because it is too basic, if we only need to master a language that can really enhance my quality of life, learning planning, and career, it is far from enough! 

So, in 2023, since C is not recommended as an initiation, which language should I start learning programming in? 

â€”â€”Python 

##  New "Internet celebrity" Python charm

 As a new "Internet celebrity" in computers, I am not surprised that Python has become so popular. For example, it:  

##  summarize 

Having said so much, I still say the same thing. The bottom layer of Python is implemented in C language. If you want to go deep into the computer industry and want to start with the basics and have enough time (after learning C language to be successfully employed for at least 2 years), it is recommended to learn C language first, and then Python. However, if you just want to master a programming language and learn it for 3 months to half a year, you can solve problems in life independently: crawling data, data analytics, and improving work efficiency... I suggest you choose Python!

 Just tell everyone what to learn but do not give direction is tantamount to playing hooligans, here is also to share my collection of technical dry goods, you can share with friends who like my articles, if you are willing to take the time to sink your heart to learn, they will definitely help you, dry goods content includes: All the above information I have packaged and uploaded to the CSDN official, click ðŸ‘‡ to get it if you need it!
