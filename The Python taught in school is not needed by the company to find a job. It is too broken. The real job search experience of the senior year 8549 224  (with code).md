If you only rely on what you learn in school to find a job, can you find a job? 

Today, I will show you a real job search case of a fan. I want to do a job in Python, but I submitted more than 20 resumes but no one wanted them. My mentality collapsed. Why no one wants them? I will tell you the answer.

Then I will combine my years of recruitment and development experience to give some good advice to all college students. If you can do what I say, you will be eager to submit your resume to companies. 

###  First, real college student job search cases 

This is the real job search situation of one of my fans, and I also gave him corresponding suggestions later. The chat record has been negotiated with him, and he agrees to put it in the article after coding.

  What do you think? If it was such a candidate, would you want it from a technical perspective? 

At least I feel that if I were still responsible for the recruitment of technical positions, I would basically not give interviews, because I have too few technical stacks, and I may have to teach too many things after recruitment. 

This is the reality. It's not that I deliberately attack. If we can't face up to our own shortcomings, it's not just that what I said is a little unpleasant. Society is even more cruel.

But some people have just graduated, and when they go for an interview, the company is rushing to ask for it. Why is this? 

To put it bluntly, it is technology and experience. Next, I will talk about it. Let's first look at technology, that is, what should we learn if we take the Python direction. 

###  What do you need to learn about Python? 

Python can go in multiple directions, such as crawlers, data analytics, automated testing, back-end development, and artificial intelligence. Since there are many technical points to learn in each direction, I will not explain them one by one. I have made a learning roadmap for each direction. 

It can be said that if you can master 90% of the things on the roadmap, you will have no problem finding a job purely from a technical perspective.

  You can compare the technical points I mentioned with what the senior student has mastered. There is a lot of lack, indicating that his skills are still not in place.

This is only a basic level of data analytics should learn, usually with the crawler to find a job is still passable. But if you just want to go data analytics alone, then you have to improve, the direction I wrote in the figure above point 6.

To be honest, Python back-end in the domestic demand is not Java, but the competition will be slightly less, if you want to use Python back-end, I suggest you learn the front-end, it is difficult to go back-end, then full stack. 

The front-end learning roadmap also includes:

  Automated tests are also good, they have gradually replaced the old tests, the salary is also good, and the threshold is not that high.

The salary in artificial intelligence is very high, and the future is promising, but the threshold is also very high. If you do not have a graduate degree or have achieved great success in undergraduate studies (such as the top three in the competition), it is basically not recommended for everyone to toss in this direction. 

###  III. How to get companies to rush you 

The above are all technical learning directions. If you want to get a soft interview offer, it is recommended to strengthen the following things, which will be more secure. 

Databases are something that most programmers must master, just like crawlers. When you leave the database, it's a small matter. The vast majority of work collaboration requires the use of databases. 

No matter whether it is SQL or NoSQL, you need to know one. When you are in college, it is recommended to learn MySQL or MongoDB.

Make sure to do projects to practice. It's not enough to list the technology stacks you know, but there is something to prove that you have mastered them. 

The project can be used for reference, but it is not to change the soup without changing the medicine, but to directly change the quantity and run it? Of course not, you have to think about it thoroughly, and then upgrade it to make it have more practical functions. 

For a simple example, if you create a website that starts by displaying text and images, and you figure it out, can you add a chat function to it? Or can you try to allow others to sign up for concurrent articles? Even if you can use a recommendation algorithm to make it recommend according to user preferences, then the upgrade is successful. 

There are not many projects, just do one or two that can be done. 

Just came out of school, or just transferred from other industries to the IT industry, be sure to look for a job with a learning mindset. Don't expect too much salary at the beginning. Mainly focus on learning technology and project experience. After a year, you can look at job-hopping. After settling, your salary will definitely increase a lot. 

###  IV. Summary 

Finally, let me summarize for you: 

>  1. Technology must be deeply drilled, not a little bit of everything, it is best to learn in a certain direction.. 2. If the things taught in school are not deep enough, then extend them by yourself. To put it bluntly, university is the teacher who leads the door, and the practice depends on the individual.. 3. Be sure to add shining points to yourself, such as being proficient in databases and having projects that you can do well.
