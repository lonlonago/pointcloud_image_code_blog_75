###  foreword 

All along, many friends who want to learn Python have asked me, how to learn Python? How to learn crawlers and data analytics? Can you teach me the learning path of web development? 

Let me tell you something first. No matter what training course you sign up for or whether you are self-learning through various channels, you must pay attention to one thing: a complete body of knowledge. 

Feeling very confused? After learning for a while, you are still not fluent? A large part of the reason is that you do not have a complete knowledge system, and you do not know your current progress and future direction. 

On the third day of the Dragon Boat Festival, although I went back to the countryside, I still took the time to do the learning route of all directions of Python, and I will share it with you today. 

###  Getting Started with Python 

Beginners will be curious. After learning Python for so long, to what extent is it considered an entry point? 

Everyone has a different understanding of technology. In my personal opinion, you can start with the following things. Why? Because the following things are the basic knowledge necessary for Python to advance in all directions. If you advance to learn crawling or web development, you must first learn them. 

Because there are many knowledge points together, I divide them into basic and advanced programming. For every self-taught person, follow this system to lay a solid foundation, and your future path will be more stable.

###  Second, reptiles 

As a popular direction, crawling is a good choice whether it is a part-time job or an auxiliary skill to improve work efficiency. Of course, there are also some crawler engineers who use this as their main profession. 

So how can crawlers learn to become a system? Intermediate level crawlers don't need a lot of things. Refer to this system to learn. If you can master 90%, you can confidently say that you are proficient in crawlers.

###  III. Data analytics 

Everyone knows that data is the most precious thing in this era, but there is a premise that you must understand that all data that does not function properly is junk data. 

The mission of data analytics is to play the role that data should play: direct and indirect. 

If you are an IT professional engaged in big data-related work, I suggest you master but don't stop at the following data systems. Don't think that if you know Numpy, Pandas, or Matplotlib, you will know data analytics. The truly powerful things are yet to come. 

If you regard data analytics as an auxiliary skill, then after learning the following, they can meet most of your needs. Some small partners may still be non-computer professionals and engage in non-IT jobs, such as operations, then I suggest you learn Python beginners + crawlers + data analytics, they are enough to improve your work efficiency in the workplace, without wasting time in the direction of full stack, testing, etc., which is not of great help to you.

###  IV. Web development (front/back end) 

Web development is a hot topic in the programmer profession. At present, there is still a large talent gap. Web development is divided into three directions: front-end, back-end, and full-stack. At present, the mainstream in China is still separated from the front-end and back-end. The front-end mainly considers user experience, and the back-end mainly considers the underlying business logic, platform stability, and performance. The most important thing is which part do you want to do? Do you like to be the part that the user can see, or consider the part that the user cannot see? 

As for the full stack, public opinion has been very strong, with mixed reviews. My advice is that if time and effort permit, it is not wrong to pursue a more comprehensive technical approach.

 Applicable audience: front-end/back-end/full-stack engineers   

###  V. Automated testing 

Automated testing is a trend in the future. Nowadays, many enterprises require programmers to have the ability to automate testing. For the field of automated testing, Python is currently the most suitable language.

###  Six, machine learning 

Machine learning is the only way to artificial intelligence, and the difficulty is much greater than the previous one. Dealing with algorithms is commonplace, and high pay will also bring high returns. The salary is very good. Although Python is indeed very strong in this regard, it reminds everyone that the threshold in this field is relatively high, and undergraduates are basically excluded. It is recommended to obtain a master's degree or above before considering entering this industry.

###  Message 

The above is the learning path for all directions of Python. After mastering 90% of the directions you are interested in, it is not a problem for you to find a job. 

Some attentive friends may find that I did not put the artificial intelligence learning route. To be honest, artificial intelligence is much more extensive than machine learning, and it is no longer something that can be done alone in a certain language, so it is not recommended here. 

Similarly, cyber security engineers I did not include in the talk, although Python can also do cyber security things, but for a mature cyber security engineer or even red, H customers, you need to be proficient in more than one language, or that this is no longer a problem at the level of language tools. 

Then, I wish you all success in your studies.
