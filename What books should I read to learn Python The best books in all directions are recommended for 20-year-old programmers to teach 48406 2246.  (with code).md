The reason for writing this article is that I have received no less than 10 fans recently asking me what book to buy in Python, especially when I saw that some fans actually bought this book "Python Programming Practice" as an introductory Python book for beginners. After seeing it, I couldn't help but be stunned... 

![avatar]( f133f5e89ee1ab49a916ddb80be9992b.png) 

It's not that this book is rubbish. I have also read this book. The book is not very thick, and it can be read in a few days. It talks about some very basic knowledge, and some places are very jumping, and it is not explained clearly. I think with this money, you can buy higher quality and more suitable books, and the harvest will never be less than this one. 

After working for more than 20 years, I have read more than 200 technical books myself. Now there are more than 50 books that I personally like in the study at home, and I will read them from time to time. Reading books has become a habit that I have maintained over the years. 

In order to enable more people who want to learn Python by reading books to spend their money on the cutting edge, I have summarized all the popular Python books that I personally think are cost-effective and worth reading. Today, I will share with you some of the best books. Some of them are no worse than the current paid courses on the market. 

###  Getting Started with Python 

![avatar]( 0fc914a550333f5ecc597e8c5064fdb4.png) 

If you are a beginner learning Python, I recommend this book "Python Programming From Introduction to Practice". It is a very small white book with friendly content and no esoteric knowledge points. The explanation is in place, allowing small white to quickly understand Python and enjoy the confidence and interest brought by programming. 

This book is divided into two parts: basic knowledge and project practice. First, you learn the basics of Python step by step, and then through the practical training of high-quality projects, you can develop your programming thinking, analyze the skills and angles of problems, and definitely benefit a lot. 

This book is based on Python 3, and there is no problem with this book as an introductory book. Python's common application fields are also included. After learning the basics, if you want to expand to a specific application field, then you can go to the specific application field book. 

###  Second, the direction of web crawlers 

![avatar]( c9f3cde43ecf417fb9208c6b7f7833e6.png) 

If you are a beginner with zero foundation or a relatively weak foundation and want to learn from crawlers, I recommend the book "Python Programming Quick Start, Second Edition". 

This book mainly talks about the basics of Python, web crawlers, and automated office (Excel/word/PDF). It is very suitable for novice beginners to go in the direction of web crawlers, because web crawlers are not only front-end data capture, but also back-end data storage and processing. Otherwise, if you climb down a lot of messy data, your scalp will be numb, so the addition of automated office can make web crawlers even more powerful. 

At the end of each chapter, there are some exercises and in-depth practical projects to help readers consolidate their knowledge. The appendix provides the answers to all the exercises, which can be said to be a rare masterpiece for learning about crawlers.

If you are a Python-based learner who wants to develop into a crawler, then you can check out the book "Python Web Data Collection". 

This book is specifically about web crawlers, and it goes straight to the point. Therefore, it is not suitable for beginners with zero or weak foundation, but more suitable for people who have learned Python to read. It will save you a lot of time and effort, and it is not thick, only about 200 pages. The extended version of this practical book not only introduces web crawling, but also serves as a comprehensive guide to crawling almost all types of data from the modern web.

###  III. Direction of data analytics 

![avatar]( ef2220c7c30ffd126a8b3195c33e86b4.png) 

In the field of data analytics, if you have a foundation in Python, I recommend the book "Data Analytics with Python". 

Those who have come into contact with data analytics know our commonly used Pandas. This book happened to be written by the founder of the Pandas project. It details the specific details and basic points of using Python to manipulate, process, clean, and organize data. It covers pandas, NumPy, IPython, and Jupyter, and adds a large number of practical cases to help you solve a series of data analytics problems efficiently. 

Last year, when I read the second edition of this book, I felt its enhancement, but the fly in the ointment is that the second edition of this book has some errors in translation, which is a bit worse than the first edition. I don't know if there is a revised version now. If you have the ability, I suggest reading the English version, because this book is really strong in data analytics. 

![avatar]( 3ca076b44c2f6fe72fb7ff7609bf3d86.png) 

If you are a novice with zero or weak foundation in Python, you can start with this "Python Data Analytics Fundamentals Tutorial". 

This is a book published by People's Publishing House last year. It tells readers a lot about the basics of Python and the introduction of data. It is very friendly for beginners, and it is also a project exercise with chapters. In the key part of this article, it focuses on the specific operation of NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and machine learning library scikit-learn, and there are several good real projects. 

It can be said that it is a rare good book from zero foundation to proficiency in data analytics, but is it suitable for people with a foundation to read this book? Of course, there is no need to read it. You can read its second edition, which will save a lot of time by starting directly with NumPy. 

###  IV. Front-end development direction 

For the front-end essential HTML and CSS, I personally don't think there is a need to read books. The two newly added points are really fast and numerous. Just by looking at which book you may have to abandon learning new technical points shortly after you learn it. Generally speaking, it is enough to master the basics. There are many resources on the Internet to learn the basics, such as Cainiao tutorials and so on. 

In addition to HTML and CSS, there are many points involved in front-end, such as AJAX, etc., but the indispensable one is our JS. Regarding JS, I personally have to recommend one of the best-known red books in the industry. 

![avatar]( 8a3ee65efbbcd13a4b7ebd03170675d1.png) 

This "JavaScript Advanced Programming" is also known as the Red Treasure Book. This book is more friendly to beginners than the Rhino Book "The Definitive Guide to JavaScript". The Rhino Book is more like a dictionary-style book, which is a bit boring and difficult to understand. However, the Red Treasure Book is more gentle and easy to understand, and it takes you to understand JS from simple to deep. 

Red Treasure Book has also released its 4th edition, which also adds a lot of things, such as mobile end detection, rich text editor, html5, etc. It may not be a quick book, but it will definitely give you a comprehensive JS knowledge sedimentation. 

This book is relatively thick, with more than 800 pages and a wide range of coverage. It will take a long time to read, but it is not the end. It is a book that is very suitable for collection and repeated reading. 

###  V. Back-end development direction 

![avatar]( f14982649e6dbf39d68e534edca6ce65.png) 

Many people who do website design do not really understand HTTP, here is a recommended "Illustrated HTTP" book, this book can not only understand the HTTP protocol, the most interesting is in the second half of the book to see how the HTTP protocol based on stateless simple protocol, to solve the technical challenges brought by the new interaction pattern. 

This book is suitable for web development engineers, including front-end and back-end, as well as readers at all levels who are interested in the HTTP protocol. It is not only easy to understand, but also easy to read, with only 300 pages. 

Database books I recommend two very classic and useful books, one is "SQL must know" and the other is "High-performance MySQL". You can choose one of these two books to read. Choose the corresponding book to read according to your interests or work needs. If you don't know it now, then I think you can read "High-performance MySQL". MySQL is a popular database at the moment, and "High-performance MySQL" is indeed a classic in the database community. It covers all knowledge points, whether it is a DBA or a front-end and back-end developer. I think it is a book worth learning over and over again. 

![avatar]( 13ff228efb5a173e4588fcb144beca9b.png) 

These two books are designed for people with a solid foundation. If your foundation is not good, then go and learn the basics of Python before reading.

###  VI. Automated testing direction 

![avatar]( 6410f74f6d454a8fdb1077902ab8a9dc.png) 

This book is aimed at learners with zero foundation. Before the book, there were many explanations on Python knowledge. Before I read it, it was still the second edition. This book is still very friendly to people who have not been exposed to the field of automated testing. There are a few parts about selenium and a lot of places about automation concepts. However, it is still good as an introductory book. Now it has been published in the third edition. 

For developers with testing experience or a foundation in Python, the book "Pytest Testing Practices" is a good fit. 

![avatar]( 27ff696d90ee2c09c172207cff7e3691.png) 

"Pytest Testing Practice" I personally think is a classic book that test engineers must read. There are many test examples in it, and the use of pytest, especially the use of unique fixtures, is explained very thoroughly. As the most popular Python testing tool in the industry, it would be a pity to miss it. 

###  VII, machine learning and artificial intelligence 

This book is written by François Chollet, the father of Keras and currently a researcher of Google artificial intelligence. It is a masterpiece and one of the best-known and rare books in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The content is easy to understand. When I read this book, I had never been exposed to the field of machine learning, but I was still able to understand it when I read this book. It can be said to be a good entry. 

![avatar]( a8beb6a38ec1fd6651e8e9d71ea6f30e.png) 

The book basically revolves around Keras to talk about various implementations of deep learning, from CNN, RNN to GAN, etc., which are generally introductory, but also carry many authors' thoughts on the integrity of deep learning. It is worth mentioning that the author recommends using GPU to run the examples in the book. This is no joke. Running with CPU will make you feel very desperate. 

This book I have to make a recommendation, is currently our country's rare machine learning peak, made by Li Hang, compared to Zhou Zhihua's watermelon book "machine learning" is much stronger, watermelon book is really boring, I also did not know where to put it after reading it, but Li Hang's "statistical learning method" I read it many times. 

![avatar]( 92ca2ce5cb2a66632d2f06ed6d4cd4b3.png) 

The mainstream techniques of machine learning are mentioned in the book, and they are streamlined and not verbose. There are no extra diagrams, which give you a clear understanding of the principle. With appropriate examples, it can be said that it is a classic in the statistical learning textbook, and it is currently in the second edition. 

###  Advance in other directions 

The above is to introduce to you the books that I personally think are good in all directions of Python. If you read the books in the direction you are interested in and want to read some advanced books to improve your technical stack, you can start from the following directions. Of course, these directions have jumped out of the scope of Python. 

For programming, in addition to language proficiency, the most important thing is data structures and algorithms. 

![avatar]( 20210529191945340.jpg) 

 In this regard, I recommend the book "Introduction to Algorithms", which is not suitable for beginners because it requires a strong foundation in mathematics and a deep foundation in data structures and algorithms.  

![avatar]( 20210529191959372.jpg) 

 Compared to the previous book, "Algorithms" is more acceptable and should be suitable for most friends who learn data structures and algorithms. This book covers the basic data structures and algorithms very comprehensively, and basically it can become a book for you to learn data structures and algorithms well.  

There is no book that you can change to a higher-paying job after reading it, but if you read it carefully, your thinking will be greatly broadened, which may also improve your thinking, allowing you to think of better ways to solve problems at work 

Although we introduced the book "Illustrated HTTP" in the backend book earlier, TCP/IP is naturally indispensable in computer networking. 

I have always felt that the book "TCP/IP Explained in Detail" is the best book for me to read the TCP/IP protocol stack, although this book is very obscure and classic, so it must be recommended. Of course, there is also a book "Computer Networking, Top Down". Looking at all the books on computer networking, I don't think there is any other better book than them, so you can choose one of them. 

![avatar]( 9b41dd0086aa22c3272ba8fab7593acf.png) 

As we all know, C language development is rarely done on Windows, basically based on Linux operating system, as a good programmer, for Linux understanding is essential. 

![avatar]( 20210529192029658.jpg) 

 First of all, I recommend Brother Bird's "Linux Private Kitchen" to everyone. This book mainly talks about the use of Linux operating system, because it is the main command, which is very suitable for reference books. If you are basically familiar with the content inside, then you must be able to come in handy. You don't need to remember the details, but you need to know which command is for what. It is recommended that you read it again.  

"Linux private kitchen" is only about the use of Linux operating system, but if you want to learn to program on Linux operating system, it is recommended to see this book called "Unix environment advanced programming", C language is better, will not be in Linux operating system programming actual combat, then it is just a toy. 

![avatar]( 20210529192106450.jpg) 

 "Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" will cover a lot of practical aspects, such as file IO, multi-threaded programming, networking, sockets, etc., making it very practical and classic.  

Finally, I would like to recommend a book on code quality, which is also the book that has had the greatest impact on me. I have gained a lot of experience and skills from it, "Refactoring and Improving the Design of Existing Code". This book is about the best practice. Of course, you need to have a certain programming foundation.

###  Conclusion 

I started reading these books when I was working. At that time, I had a regret that I didn't read a few more books when I was studying, especially when the library was free. 

This is one of the books I have read so far about Python and programming. I personally think it is a very good book. Although I have read a lot of technical books, everyone is at a different technical level when they read, so the understanding and judgment of books are also different, but it does not affect the way we look back on the road we have traveled and the books we have read. We all want to leave some better references for those who follow. 

To borrow a famous writer Bing Xin's words to encourage everyone: read well, read more, read good books. 

Some good books on Python or programming languages, in addition to the above, what else have you read? Feel free to leave a comment in the comment area!
