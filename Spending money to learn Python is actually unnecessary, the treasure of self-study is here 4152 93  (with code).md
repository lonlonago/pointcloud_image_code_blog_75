Some people spend a lot of money to learn Python, but in fact, it is also possible to learn Python by yourself. If you are not in a hurry, you can try to learn it by yourself. Not everyone is suitable for learning Python. It is not a good decision to start spending money at this time. It is recommended to find resources to learn by yourself first. If you are still interested in programming after learning for a period of time, then you can continue to learn by yourself or spend some money "by car". 

Self-study is more about resources and methods. I have sorted out this aspect, and the Python resources I have collected are available to everyone. As long as you are my fan, you can take away the following items. 

Let me introduce these resources first, don't you don't know how to use them when you get them, and finally put them in the network disk. 

(1) The learning path in all directions of Python (new version) 

The learning roadmap is a compilation of technical points in a certain direction to form a summary of knowledge points in various fields. Its usefulness is that you can follow the above knowledge points to find corresponding learning resources to ensure that you learn more comprehensively. 

Previously, I made a learning roadmap for all directions of Python, and recently I took the time to update it to see that the learning roadmap for all directions is more detailed.

(2) Python learning videos 

It contains more than 100 learning videos on Python beginners, crawlers, data analytics, and web development. Although it is not as comprehensive, it is no problem for beginners. After learning these, you can follow my learning route to find other knowledge resources online to advance.

(3) More than 100 practice projects 

When we watch videos to learn, we can't just use our eyes and brains without doing anything. The more scientific learning method is to use them after understanding. At this time, the practice project is very suitable, but there are many projects in it, and the level is also uneven. You can choose the projects you can do to practice.

(4) More than 200 e-books. Over the years, I have also collected a lot of e-books, probably more than 200. Sometimes it is inconvenient to bring physical books, so I will open the e-books to have a look. Books are not necessarily worse than video tutorials, especially authoritative technical books. 

Basically, there are both mainstream and classic ones. I will not put pictures here. There is no problem with copyright issues. 

(5) Summary of Python knowledge points 

The summary of knowledge points is a bit like a learning route, but the difference from the learning route is that the summary of knowledge points is more detailed, including a simple description of specific knowledge points, while our learning route is more abstract and simple, just to make it easier for everyone to learn which technology stacks you should learn in a certain field.

(6) Other information

 There are other things, such as Python Chinese version of the library information, MySQL and HTML tags, etc., which are all things that can be given to fans.  

These are not very valuable things, but for learners who don't have many resources or don't know how to choose resources, they are really good. If you use them, you can just take them away. Anyone who has followed me knows that these are all available.

Finally, I wish you success in your studies, and don't spray if you don't like it.
